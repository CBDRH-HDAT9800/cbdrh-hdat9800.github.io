# What's in the lectures and tutorials for this Chapter?

The pre-recorded lecture covers: 

* pragmatic focus on how to create data visualisations in R
* with a little bit of underlying theory
* quick overview of the `base R` graphics and `lattice` graphics systems
* then focus on `ggplot2`
  * in subsequent chapters weâ€™ll look at add-ons and extensions to the `ggplot2` framework
  * as well as a bit more theory on good visualisation practice

After viewing the pre-recorded lecture below (the slide deck for it is available below the video), you should go through the interactive learnr tutorial available from the Tutorial page for this chapter. 

There is just one `learnr` tutorial for Chapter 3 covering the use of the `ggplot2` library for R. This covers much of the same material as the lecture for Chapter 3, but in a lot more detail, and includes a worked example of a statistical analysis of a dataset facilitated by visualisation using `ggplot2`. 

Links and further instructions for each component are provided in the sections below.

# Pre-recorded lecture for Chapter 3

View the lecture video below, and download the lecture notes (separated into part A and part B if you want to follow along with the presenter (or for revision later).

After you have viewed the lecture, please proceed to do the related `ggplot2` tutorial (see below).

# `learnr` tutorial for Chapter 3

You should download and install the `hdat9800` tutorials package for `R` by following the instructions provided on the home page. Instructions for installing `R` and `RStudio` are provided [here](installing_r.html).

The tutorial is also available online via the link from the course schedule table on the course home page.

The tutorial covers much of the same `ggplot2` material as in the pre-recorded lecture, but goes into quite a lot more detail. 

If you have any questions about the lectures or tutorials, or if you want to share any useful resources or post insights, please post in the [Teams space](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a7ce6b5565a284b51b0e85c20ad2bcc2a%40thread.tacv2/Chapter%25202?groupId=40f150b6-6fa9-478e-875f-cd02465b18a2&tenantId=3ff6cfa4-e715-48db-b8e1-0867b9f9fba3) for the course, in the channel for Chapter 3.

# Interactive sessions for Chapter 3

Details will appear here soon.

# Chapter 3 assessment exercise

For Chapter 2, the assessment exercise is intended to give you some practice modifying R code to create specific visualiastions using the `ggplot2` package, and embedding that code in an Rmarkdown documents. The framework for the Rmarkdown document you will be completing is supplied, and the coding tasks should be fairly straightforward if you have worked through the pre-recorded lecture and the `learnr` tutorial for Chapter 3. Access the assessment the same way as for previous chapters, by clicking on this link to the Chapter 3 assessment GitHub Classroom repository:  [https://classroom.github.com/a/QqP0VEjV](https://classroom.github.com/a/QqP0VEjV)

This will create a new GitHub repository for you, just for this assignment. Only you and the course instructors can access it, it is not public.

You should then clone this assignment repository to your local computer, using RStudio (or other git interfaces such as GitHub Desktop if you prefer). Complete the assignment (assessment task) according to the instructions given, save and commit your work to your local git repository, and then push that work back to the remote `GitHub` repository for the assessment (this should all be automatically set up when you clone the repo in RStudio).

**Be sure that you can successfully knit the `Rmd` (R markdown) document that you will be working on in those assessment, before you commit and push your final version. The instructors will be marking your `Rmd` file by re-rendering it (re-knitting it).**

You may revise your assessment task(s) as many times as you wish. We will mark the last committed version that you push to the GitHub repository for your chapter assessment by the due date. 

## Requesting early marking

You may request early marking of your submitted assessment by following the steps outlined [here](requesting_early_marking.html).
