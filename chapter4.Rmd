After you have viewed the lecture, please proceed to do the related `conflicts in git` tutorial (see below).

# `learnr` tutorial for Chapter 4

You should download and re-install the `hdat9800` tutorials package for `R` by following the instructions provided on the home page. Instructions for installing `R` and `RStudio` are provided [here](installing_r.html).

The tutorial for this chapter is also available online via the link from the course schedule table on the course home page.

The tutorial covers much of the same  material as in the pre-recorded lecture, but goes into quite a lot more detail. 

If you have any questions about the lectures or tutorials, or if you want to share any useful resources or post insights, please post in the [Teams space](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a7ce6b5565a284b51b0e85c20ad2bcc2a%40thread.tacv2/Chapter%25202?groupId=40f150b6-6fa9-478e-875f-cd02465b18a2&tenantId=3ff6cfa4-e715-48db-b8e1-0867b9f9fba3) for the course, in the channel for Chapter 4.

# Interactive sessions for Chapter 4

The Chapter 4 interactive sessions (online Wednesday at 6pm, face-to-face Thursday at 2pm) will cover the following topics:

* guest presentation by Dr Georgina Kennedy on data visualisation in python
* Q&A on Chapter 3 (and previous chapters) curriculum material
* if we have time (otherwise carried-over to week 5):
  * discussion/recap of the core readings for this week (see below, please reading them before the section if possible, but we will be briefly recapping the main points)
  * a hands-on workshop on exploring more aspects of the `ggplot2` package 

For the hands-on workshop (if we have time), you will need your laptop with `R` and `RStudio` installed You need to have installed the `dplyr` and `ggplot2` packages. The easiest way to do that is to just install the `tidyverse` meta-package, if you have not already done so. We'll be installing a few other packages during the session.

There is no slide deck for the textbook readings and `ggplot2` exercise this week, but there will be one for next week including this weeks readings.

The slide deck for Dr Georgie Kennedy's talk on data viz in python will be posted here on Thurs afternoon 23 June.

# Chapter 4 assessment exercise

For Chapter 4, the assessment exercise is intended to check your understanding of the material covered in the Chpater 4 pre-recorded lecture. The framework for the Rmarkdown document you will be completing is supplied, and you just need to fill in your answers as text. Access the assessment the same way as for previous chapters, by clicking on this link to the Chapter 4 assessment GitHub Classroom repository:  [https://classroom.github.com/a/Tu9O8IFj](https://classroom.github.com/a/Tu9O8IFj)

This will create a new GitHub repository for you, just for this assignment. Only you and the course instructors can access it, it is not public.

You should then clone this assignment repository to your local computer, using RStudio (or other git interfaces such as GitHub Desktop if you prefer). Complete the assignment (assessment task) according to the instructions given, save and commit your work to your local git repository, and then push that work back to the remote `GitHub` repository for the assessment (this should all be automatically set up when you clone the repo in RStudio).

**Be sure that you can successfully knit the `Rmd` (R markdown) document that you will be working on in those assessment, before you commit and push your final version. The instructors will be marking your `Rmd` file by re-rendering it (re-knitting it).**

You may revise your assessment task(s) as many times as you wish. We will mark the last committed version that you push to the GitHub repository for your chapter assessment by the due date. 

## Requesting early marking

You may request early marking of your submitted assessment by following the steps outlined [here](requesting_early_marking.html).
