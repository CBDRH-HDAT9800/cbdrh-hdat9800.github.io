# What's in the lectures and tutorials for this Chapter?

This week we look at some more advanced aspects of incorporating maps (using leaflet) in Shiny apps, including:

* lazy evaluation of maps
* map grids
* _leafletProxy_
* leaflet callbacks

[**Slide deck for Chapter 9**](assets/HDAT9800-2022-T2-Chapter-9.pdf)

After you have viewed the lecture, please proceed to do the related `reactivity in shiny` tutorial (see below) if you have not already done it.

#  `learnr` tutorial for Chapters 8 & 9

You should download and re-install the `hdat9800` tutorials package for `R` by following the instructions provided on the home page. Instructions for installing `R` and `RStudio` are provided [here](installing_r.html).

The tutorial for this chapter is also available [online](https://cbdrh.shinyapps.io/reactivity/) via the link from the course schedule table on the course home page.

The tutorial covers much of the same  material as in the pre-recorded lecture for Chapter 8, but goes into quite a lot more detail. 

If you have any questions about the lectures or tutorials, or if you want to share any useful resources or post insights, please post in the [Teams space](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3af1876c04b0a44549bd2aa63050155355%40thread.tacv2/Chapter%25206?groupId=40f150b6-6fa9-478e-875f-cd02465b18a2&tenantId=3ff6cfa4-e715-48db-b8e1-0867b9f9fba3) for the course, in the channel for Chapter 8.

# Interactive sessions for Chapter 9

In the interactive session we will have a guest presentation from Dr Nic Kuo on dimensionality reduction, which can be very useful for visualising high dimensionality data. 

The slide deck for Nic's talk can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FcFPjWqoXVbtxjUcwtPdY1yqJT1gH27CC9z9jP8f8rc/edit#slide=id.p).

An Rmarkdown notebook illustrating the use of t-SNE which Nic spoke about is available as a GitHub gists [here](https://gist.github.com/timchurches/95f348aa8765beddaa9e2ff6a06b5c2f). You can download that (or just copy and paste the code into an Rmd file on your laptop) and run each section.


We will also consider 3D visualisations (note: this has been held over to Chapter 10), their uses and misuses. We will review [Chapter 26 of the Wilke textbook](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/no-3d.html), in which he admonishes against the use of 3D visualisations except in some special circumstances, and then we rather informally look at examples of 3D visualisation and the facilities for creating then in R. A set of links to the things we examine will be posted here after the session.

Other issues to be discussed:

* news (including that the [RStudio not-for-profit company](https://www.rstudio.com) is re-branding as [Posit](https://posit.co) and expanding their focus to include python as well as R, including quarto (knitr for python) and shiny-for-python)
* assessment marking
* Q&A about core chapter content
* questions about the additional and group assessment tasks
* what to cover or revisit next week (the final interactive session)
* the MyExperience survey

# Chapter 9 assessment exercise

There is **no** assessment for Chapter 9. Concentrate on your individual additional assessment and your group assessment projects instead.

# Readings and Resources for Chapter 9

There are no new readings for this week, to allow everyone to catch up. Thus we will revisit Chapters 10 and 11 of Wilke.

```{r, eval=TRUE, include=TRUE}

reading = c(
      "Claus O. Wilke. Fundamentals of Data Visualization. Chapter 15 - Visualising geospatial data",
      "Claus O. Wilke. Fundamentals of Data Visualization. Chapter 16 - Visualising uncertainty",
      "RStudio. Building Web Applications with Shiny - module 4 - customising the UI",
      "Claus O. Wilke. Fundamentals of Data Visualization. Chapter 26 - Don't go 3D"
    )

links <- c(
  "<a class='fa fa-globe' href='https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/geospatial-data.html' target='_blank'></a>",
  "<a class='fa fa-globe' href='https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/visualizing-uncertainty.html' target='_blank'></a>",
  "<a class='fa fa-globe' href='https://minecr.shinyapps.io/04-ui/' target='_blank'></a>",
  "<a class='fa fa-globe' href='https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/no-3d.html' target='_blank'></a>"
)


df <- data.frame(
  reading = reading,
  links = links
)


kbl(df, escape = FALSE,
    align = c('l', 'c'),
    col.names = NULL) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "hover") %>% 
    kableExtra::group_rows(start_row = 1, end_row = 2, group_label = "Core readings")  %>% 
    kableExtra::group_rows(start_row = 3, end_row = 4, group_label = "Optional but recommended readings") 

```

You should prioritise the core readings each week.
