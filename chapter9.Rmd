# What's in the lectures and tutorials for this Chapter?

This week we look at some more advanced aspects of incorporating maps (using leaflet) in Shiny apps, including:

* lazy evaluation of maps
* map grids
* _leafletProxy_
* leaflet callbacks

After you have viewed the lecture, please proceed to do the related `reactivity in shiny` tutorial (see below) if you have not already done it.

#  `learnr` tutorial for Chapters 8 & 9

You should download and re-install the `hdat9800` tutorials package for `R` by following the instructions provided on the home page. Instructions for installing `R` and `RStudio` are provided [here](installing_r.html).

The tutorial for this chapter is also available [online](https://cbdrh.shinyapps.io/reactivity/) via the link from the course schedule table on the course home page.

The tutorial covers much of the same  material as in the pre-recorded lecture for Chapter 8, but goes into quite a lot more detail. 

If you have any questions about the lectures or tutorials, or if you want to share any useful resources or post insights, please post in the [Teams space](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3af1876c04b0a44549bd2aa63050155355%40thread.tacv2/Chapter%25206?groupId=40f150b6-6fa9-478e-875f-cd02465b18a2&tenantId=3ff6cfa4-e715-48db-b8e1-0867b9f9fba3) for the course, in the channel for Chapter 8.

# Interactive sessions for Chapter 9

In the interactive session we will have a guest presentation from Dr Nic Luo on dimensionality reduction. Other content and activities for this session will be advised.

# Chapter 9 assessment exercise

There is **no** assessment for Chapter 9. Concentrate on your individual additional assessment and your group assessment projects instead.

# Readings and Resources for Chapter 9

There are no new readings for this week, to allow everyone to catch up. Thus we will revisit Chapters 10 and 11 of Wilke.

```{r, eval=TRUE, include=TRUE}

reading = c(
      "Claus O. Wilke. Fundamentals of Data Visualization. Chapter 15 - Visualising geospatial data",
      "Claus O. Wilke. Fundamentals of Data Visualization. Chapter 16 - Visualising uncertainty",
      "RStudio. Building Web Applications with Shiny - module 4 - customising the UI"
    )

links <- c(
  "<a class='fa fa-globe' href='https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/geospatial-data.html' target='_blank'></a>",
  "<a class='fa fa-globe' href='https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/visualizing-uncertainty.html' target='_blank'></a>",
  "<a class='fa fa-globe' href='https://minecr.shinyapps.io/04-ui/' target='_blank'></a>"
  
)


df <- data.frame(
  reading = reading,
  links = links
)


kbl(df, escape = FALSE,
    align = c('l', 'c'),
    col.names = NULL) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "hover") %>% 
    kableExtra::group_rows(start_row = 1, end_row = 2, group_label = "Core readings")  %>% 
    kableExtra::group_rows(start_row = 3, end_row = 3, group_label = "Optional but recommended readings") 

```
