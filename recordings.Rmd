# Chapter 2

**Note:** We have provided an additional video below which more clearly illustrates the steps required to set up a blog web site using `distill`. Therefore we recommend that you watch the video of the Chapter 2 online session, below, only up to the point at which creation of a blog site is demonstrated. At that point, watch the additional video below instead.
