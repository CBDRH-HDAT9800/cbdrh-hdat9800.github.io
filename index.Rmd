# About the HDAT9800 course

Health Data Scientists need to present information to audiences across a range of backgrounds and spanning a spectrum from na√Øve or non-practitioners of a discipline to highly informed and expert audiences. Effective communication across different media types is essential. Appropriate data visualisation techniques can greatly enhance communication and increase the effectiveness of communication. Data visualisation is an essential part of every data analysis. Increasingly the scientific community has become aware of problems regarding lack of transparency and reproducibility, and the use of fully reproducible methods of working are now essential.

This course takes a toolbox approach to creating appropriate, reproducible and transparent analyses and visualisations, and communicating them via various channels and modes, including informal and formal written communication, online communication and via interactive applications. In the context of R, it presents useful best-practice data science analysis and visualisation techniques with a focus on different types of data visualisations.

This course was originally developed in 2018 by Dr James Farrow and Dr Tim Churches. It was co-presented by James and Tim in 2018 and 2019, and co-presented by James and Tim in entirely online form in 2020, and by Tim and Andy Blance in 2021. Although the core material for the course remains substantially unchanged, a great deal of additional material was added in 2021, and for 2022 some further topics will be covered.

The original course introduction recorded by Dr James Farrow appears below, and is still valid - we have not removed anything from the core curriculum, although quite a lot of the material has been updated or supplemented to reflect recent developments. The additional material added in 2021 and 2022 will be covered in the interactive sessions on Thursday afternoons/evenings in the Term 2 2022 running of the course.

# Teams Space 

Discussions, questions and online tutorials will be hosted in the course Teams Space which you can access [here](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3aAzZ6eWc0Vd4Nx8NiQE3GrUnsF6rlDeg6qIIVpspPwK41%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=40f150b6-6fa9-478e-875f-cd02465b18a2&tenantId=3ff6cfa4-e715-48db-b8e1-0867b9f9fba3).

<br>

# Weekly interactive tutorials

A weekly interactive tutorial session is offered, in both online and face-to-face formats. The material covered in both formats is identical. Each tutorial starts with a question-and-answer sessions on the core curriculum material for that and previous weeks, and then goes on to cover additional material, usually a mixture of short lectures or presentations and a hands-on practical exercise. Some weeks feature a guest presenter (see details in the course schedule table below and on each course chapter page). 

Attendance at tutorial sessions is optional but strongly encouraged. However, we recognise that some students may not be able to attend either the online or the face-to-face sessions due to work, family or other commitments. For those students, the online sessions will be recorded and available the next day for viewing at their convenience. 

<aside>
International students who have enrolled in the course for blended/hybrid delivery and who are on a student visa, **are** required to attend at least 3 hours per week of face-to-face classes on campus for each course to meet your visa requirements. Such students should make every effort to attend the face-to-face classes. If you are such a student, but you can't make it to one of the face-to-face sessions, please just let me know by email at timothy.churches@unsw.edu.au so I can keep a record of why.
</aside>

The online interactive tutorials will be held using Teams at 6pm (Sydney time) each Wednesday. The tutorial will usually last between 2 and 2.5 hours. You can join the tutorials using [this link](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3aAzZ6eWc0Vd4Nx8NiQE3GrUnsF6rlDeg6qIIVpspPwK41%40thread.tacv2/1653955762718?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%223ff6cfa4-e715-48db-b8e1-0867b9f9fba3%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%2223d7a44f-1fca-4328-b0b5-9ff6befeb010%22%7d). These tutorials should also appear in your Teams calendar.

The face-to-face interactive tutorials will be held on the UNSW Kensingtom campus in the Mathews 104 room (K-F23-104) starting at 2pm each Thursday. These tutorials will also usually last between 2 and 2.5 hours. It may not be possible for all guest presenters to attend these tutorials in person, in which case the presentations may be provided online or students may view the recorded online tutorial for those parts of the tutorial. Please bring your laptop to these tutorials.


# The tutorials R packages

Online, hosted versions of the `learnr` tutorials for this course can be accessed through the links in the Course Schedule table above, but it is better to use a local copy that you can work on in the `RStudio` environment without the need for internet access. You will need a copy of R and RStudio running on your computer in order to participate in the interactive (face-to-face or online) tutorial sessions held each Thursday, and to complete and submit assignments.

If you do not already have R and RStudio installed, please follow the instructions on the [Installing R](installing_R.html) page. If you have any problems or questions please contact the course convenor Tim Churches on teams of by email at [timothy.churches@unsw.edu.au](mailto:timothy.churches@unsw.edu.au).

Once installed, the tutorials can be accessed via the **Tutorial** tab in the upper right-hand pane of the RStudio application window.

The tutorials for Chapter 1 are shipped in the package `cbdrhintro`. To install this package you can enter the following code at the console:

```{r tute-packages-install, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
devtools::install_github("CBDRH/cbdrhintro")
```

You may get prompted to update some packages. You can chose to ignore this by selecting option 3 (None).

![](images/package-update.png){width=95%}

If you choose to update packages, you may subsequently be asked if you want to install binary or source versions. Source versions require special tools to compile which you may not have configured, so you should choose to install the binary version, i.e. if prompted _Do you want to install from sources the packages which need compilation?_ enter n for 'No'.

The package installation can occasionally fail, usually if there is a dependency that is not installed or has an outdated version. If you get an error message relating to a package, try installing that package first and then try again. If there are still issues, don't worry, just [drop an email to the course convenor](contact.html).

**Please note:** if you have installed the `cbdrhintro` previously, you will need to re-install it again because we have added a tutorial for `dplyr` required for Chapter 1 of this course. 

The tutorials for Chapters 2 onwards are shipped in the package `hdat9800tutorials`. To install this package you can enter the following code at the console:

```{r hdat9800-tute-packages-install, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
devtools::install_github("CBDRH/hdat9800")
```

You may need to re-install this package from time to time as instructed to receive updates to the tutorials.

# Assessments

## Weekly core curriculum assessments

There are weekly individual assessments for Chapters 1 to 7. Each of these assessments is worth 8% of the total marks for the course, thus 56% all together. These weekly assessments cover the core course material and should be fairly easy and will not take very long to complete if you have worked through the core curriculum material. The weekly assessments must be submitted for marking no later than three weeks after the opening date for the chapter they relate to -- the exact dates for each are shown in the table below. However, you are encouraged to submit the core curriculum assignments early, if possible, to allow more time for the additional assignments (see below). The course instructors will endeavour to mark and return assignments submitted before the due date as quickly as possible, so that you can get feedback and assurance on your progress and understanding of the course material.

## Additional assessments

There are also two additional assignments. These relate to topics covered in the Thursday tutorial sessions, but require additional independent research and some creativity to complete. Each is worth 7% of the total course marks, thus 14% all together. The exact dates on which each these are due is also shown in the table below. These assignments will be marked promptly after the due date for each.

<aside>

<br>

In the 2021 running of this course we set these additional assessment tasks every week. However, feedback from students was that the assessment burden was too great and that they didn't have time to do the additional assessments justice. Therefore we have reduced the number of these additional assessments to just two this year.

</aside>

## Group assessment

In week 6 of the course, you will be asked to form into small groups of 3 or 4 students each, to undertake a group assessment task. More details of this task will be provided in week 4 of the course. Each group will be required to present their group project in the Thursday sessions in week 10, and then submit all the code for the project in the week following that. The group assessment is worth 30% of the overall course marks.

# Readings and resources

There are links to readings and additional resources on the page for each chapter of the course. You should prioritise the core readings each week.

## Course Textbook

![](images/wilke_cover.png){width="60%"}


**Claus O. Wilke. Fundamentals of Data Visualization. O'Reilly Media, Sebestopol, CA. 2019. ISBN 978-1-492-03108-6.** 

This is a great introduction to data visualisation in the biological and biomedical sciences (the author is a biologist). Furthermore, it uses `R` throughout, and the entire text is itself written using literate programming methods in R! Best of all, it is available under a Creative Commons license and thus can be accessed and used without cost. By all means buy the published version (I have a copy), but you don't have to -- the full textbook can be [accessed online](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/). You can even access the source code for it.

Starting with Chapter 2, there will be a set reading of part of the text each week which we will discuss in the interactive sessions. Don't worry, the readings will not be very long.

## Other resources

To be updated shortly.
