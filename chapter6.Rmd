# What's in the lectures and tutorials for this Chapter?

In this chapter we look at the `Shiny` environment for `R`. `Shiny` allows you to build very sophisticated interactive web sites )or apps) using just R code. It is an example of similar environments in other programming languages which hide most of the arcane and confusing aspects of web development and allow you to concentrate on how and what you wish to communicate to the audience for the web site or app.

Topics to be covered:

* What is Shiny
* Shiny app architecture (2 or 1 file apps)
* Inside a Shiny app
* UI 
* This week's `learnr` tutorial

After viewing the pre-recorded lecture below (the slide deck for it is available below the video), you should go through the interactive learnr tutorial for this chapter (see below). 

There are also large numbers of alternative tutorials on Shiny available on the internet: some are very good, others not so good. If possible, you should go through some of these as well. The tutorials provided by RStudio (see the readings and resources table for this chapter, below) are recommended. Nonetheless, the introduction to Shiny lecture above is still a very good place to start.

After you have viewed the lecture, please proceed to do the related `Intro to shiny` tutorial (see below).

#  `learnr` tutorial for Chapter 6

You should download and re-install the `hdat9800` tutorials package for `R` by following the instructions provided on the home page. Instructions for installing `R` and `RStudio` are provided [here](installing_r.html).

The tutorial for this chapter is also available online via the link from the course schedule table on the course home page.

The tutorial covers much of the same  material as in the pre-recorded lecture, but goes into quite a lot more detail. 

If you have any questions about the lectures or tutorials, or if you want to share any useful resources or post insights, please post in the [Teams space](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3af1876c04b0a44549bd2aa63050155355%40thread.tacv2/Chapter%25206?groupId=40f150b6-6fa9-478e-875f-cd02465b18a2&tenantId=3ff6cfa4-e715-48db-b8e1-0867b9f9fba3) for the course, in the channel for Chapter 6.

# Interactive sessions for Chapter 6

The Chapter 6 interactive sessions (online Wednesday at 6pm, face-to-face Thursday at 2pm) will cover the following topics:

* Q&A on Chapter 5 (and previous chapters) curriculum material
* details of the additional assessment task
* a talk on the principles of animation in data visualisation
* a hands-on workshop on exploring practical animation using the `gganimate` package for `ggplot2`  

As usual, for the hands-on workshop, you will need your laptop with `R` and `RStudio` installed. You need to have installed the `ggplot2` package. The easiest way to do that is to just install the `tidyverse` meta-package, if you have not already done so. We'll be installing a few other packages during the session, in partcular the `gganimate` package and the `gapminder` package.

## Notes for the talk and interactive exercises

The notes for the talk and the example code fo the interactive exercises on animation can be accessed [here](Chapter-6-animation/HDAT9800-Chapter-6-animation.html).

# Chapter 6 assessment exercise

For Chapter 6, the assessment exercise is intended to check your understanding of the material covered in the Chapter 6 pre-recorded lecture and the Chapter 6 `learnr` tutorial on building interactive `shiny` apps.  The framework for the `shiny` app is supplied, and you just need to add code to build the appl functionality as instructed in the README file for the assessment. Don't be intimidated, it is easier than it seems at first!. Access the assessment repository the same way as for previous chapters, by clicking on this link to the Chapter 6 assessment GitHub Classroom repository:  [https://classroom.github.com/a/sYSWaGHH](https://classroom.github.com/a/sYSWaGHH)

This will create a new GitHub repository for you, just for this assignment. Only you and the course instructors can access it, it is not public.

You should then clone this assignment repository to your local computer, using RStudio (or other git interfaces such as GitHub Desktop if you prefer). Complete the assignment (assessment task) according to the instructions given, save and commit your work to your local git repository, and then push that work back to the remote `GitHub` repository for the assessment (this should all be automatically set up when you clone the repo in RStudio).

**Be sure that you can successfully run the `shiny` app that you will be working on in this assessment, before you commit and push your final version. The instructors will be running your app as well as looking at your code for it when marking the assessment.

You may revise your assessment task(s) as many times as you wish. We will mark the last committed version that you push to the GitHub repository for your chapter assessment by the due date. 

## Requesting early marking

You may request early marking of your submitted assessment by following the steps outlined [here](requesting_early_marking.html).
