To install this package you can enter the following code at the console:\n\n\ndevtools::install_github(\"CBDRH/hdat9700\")\n\n\n\nYou may get prompted to update some packages. You can chose to ignore this by selecting option 3 (None).\n\nIf you choose to update packages, you may subsequently be asked if you want to install binary or source versions. Source versions require special tools to compile which you may not have configured, so you should choose to install the binary version, i.e. if prompted Do you want to install from sources the packages which need compilation? enter n for ‘No’.\nThe package installation can occasionally fail, usually if there is a dependency that is not installed or has an outdated version. If you get an error message relating to a package, try installing that package first and then try again. If there are still issues, don’t worry, just drop an email to the course convenor.\n\nBack to the top \n\nAssessment\n\n\nAssessment\n\n\nTopic\n\n\nWeight\n\n\nDue date\n\n\nRepo link\n\n\nAssessment 1A\n\n\nDAGs and Matching\n\n\n50%/3\n\n\n9am, Mon 27 Jun\n\n\n\n\n\nAssessment 1B\n\n\nMultilevel modelling\n\n\n50%/3\n\n\n9am, Mon 11 Jul\n\n\n\n\n\nAssessment 1C\n\n\nTime series analysis\n\n\n50%/3\n\n\n9am, Mon 1 Aug\n\n\n\n\n\nAssessment 2\n\n\nShort report\n\n\n50%\n\n\n9am, Mon 15 Aug\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick the link to clone a personal copy of the GitHub repo for each assessment.
