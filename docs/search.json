It also provides an introduction to the core curriculum material for each of the chapter topics including an introduction to R, dplyr, literate programming, git, ggplot2, collaborating with git, using leaflet for mapping, using shiny for interactive applications, and the shiny group project (Chapter 1 - Course Overview - Part 2).\nThere is also an introduction to using git for version control (Chapter 1 - Version control with git and GitHub - Part 1), and how to set up and configure git with RStudio, how to access the assessment repository and the chapter 1 assessment (Chapter 1 - Version control with git and GitHub - Part 2).\nView the lecture videos, and download the lecture notes if you want to follow along with the presenter (or for revision later).\nAfter you have viewed the lectures, please proceed to do the learnr tutorials on git.\nThere is also an interactive learnr tutorial covering data manipulation using dplyr in R. This is also foundational material for later chapters, which will require the use of dplyr and related packages to manipulate and shape data for visualation and reporting.\nThe interactive tutorial session for Chapter 1 will start with a get-to-know-you session, in which we each introduce ourselves, and talk about our favourite data visualisation or chart (see below). There will be an opportunity for questions and answers (Q&A) about the core course material, and then a hands-on session in which we use the dplyr package in R to access and manipulate data in databases, along with a discussion of some fundamental concepts of computer architecture and operations which are important to understand when working with “big data”.\nLinks and further instructions for each component are provided in the sections below.\nPre-recorded lectures for Chapter 1\nView the lecture videos below, and download the lecture notes if you want to follow along with the presenter (or for revision later).\nAfter you have viewed the lectures, please proceed to do the related git tutorials (see below).\nCourse overview including course aims and principles (Chapter 1 - Course Overview - Part 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction of chapter topics including R, dplyr, literate programming, git, ggplot2, collaborating with git, leaflet, shiny and the shiny group project (Chapter 1 - Course Overview - Part 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSlide deck for Chapter 1 - Course Overview - Parts 1 & 2\nUsing git for version control (Chapter 1 - Version control with git and GitHub - Part 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting up and configuring git, setting up git with RStudio, how to access the assessment repository and the chapter 1 assessment (Chapter 1 - Version control with git and GitHub - Part 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSlide deck for Chapter 1 - git and GitHub - Parts 1 & 2\nTutorials for Chapter 1\nEvery chapter includes one or more interactive tutorials/practicals, which consists of introductory concepts, readings and exercises, generally provided as an R package of learnr tutorials. learnr is a package which allows interactive tutorials about R (or related topics) to be written in R.\nYou should download and install the cbdrhintro tutorials package for R by following the instructions provided on the home page. Instructions for installing R and RStudio are provided here.\nThe Chapter 1 tutorials have three parts:\nIntroduction to R tutorials (proficient R users can quickly run through or skip these tutorials, see the more detailed description of these tutorials below)\nIntroduction to git and GitHub\nIntroduction to dplyr\nPlease work through the content in the tutorials after you have watched the prerecorded lecture for this chapter.\nIf you have any questions about the tutorials, or if you want to share any useful resources or post insights, please post in the Teams space for the course, in the channel for Chapter 1.\nIntroduction to R Tutorials for Beginners\nR is fast becoming the industry standard programming language for statistical data analysis. If this is your first exposure to R, we have created some beginner R modules to introduce you to the R language and to help you build some basic programming skills.\nThe modules are delivered as 6 learnr tutorials as a R package called cbdrhintro. Each module consists of explanatory text and coding examples. The tutorials are interactive so you can write and run code to see how it works, then check your code against the provided solutions. The coding tasks in these tutorial modules are not marked assessments, so don’t worry if you make mistakes. Each module is organised into several subtopics, which are bookmarked making it easy to pause and return at a later time.\nModule 1: Introduction to R, variable types and operators\nModule 2: Vectors\nModule 3: Matrices, matrix arithmetic and lists\nModule 4: Data frames and Factors\nModule 5: Functions\nModule 6: Control structures and control-like structures\nWho should complete the Introduction to R modules?\nR programming is a major component of many of the UNSW Health Data Science courses. Some of the R dependent courses will include these same learnr tutorials as part of the course content. If you have already worked through them, there is no need to do them again (unless you wish to for revision purposes). However if you are completely new to programming or new to R, we recommend spending some time reviewing and practising the lessons of these modules during the first few weeks of the HDAT9800 course.\nFor some students, this will be a lot of material to cover. Don’t panic! The course (and the assessment due dates) are paced so that there is plenty of time to get to grips with the fundamentals of R programming. If you would like additional interactive tutorials covering the Introduction to R material or the opportunity to ask questions about it individually or in small groups, please let me know on Teams or at timothy.churches@unsw.edu.au.\nPlease follow the instructions for installing the cbdrhintro tutorials package for R on the course home page and proceed to do the dplyr tutorial. We will revisit and revise the use of dply in the interactive session, and examine how it can be used to access “big data” contained in databases, in the context of modern computing architecture and operation.\nIf you are unfamiliar with R, you should also work through the six introduction to R tutorials that are also contained in and installed by that package.\nInteractive sessions for Chapter 1\n\nIn the first interactive tutorial for the course, we will start off with introductions. Your course instructors will introduce themselves and then each student will be requested to briefly talk about themselves (where you are from, what is your work/educational background, how much experience you have had working with health or other data).\nWe would also like you to briefly present a data visualisation (by someone else) that you have found interesting, or persuasive, or even just beautiful. You only need to describe it for 30 seconds and tell us what about it interests you. It does not need to be health-related. Don’t spend too much time looking for something, it is not a marked exercise, and if you don’t have time to find something for this week, don’t worry, we can show the visualisation you chose in later weeks. Be ready to show it on your computer screen. We will create a page on the course web site to feature each of these as a lasting record.\nAfter these introductions, there will be an opportunity to ask questions about the course, the assessments and the content for Chapter 1. We will repeat this every week, and you can ask questions about earlier chapters at any time, of course.\nPlease note: Although a working knowledge of SQL is a valuable, or perhaps even an essential skill, for most data scientists, you are not expected to acquire such skills as part of this course, and none of the assessments require knowledge or understanding of SQL.\nThen we will cover some additional material: there will be a brief talk by Tim Churches on computer architecture, databases and big data, and then we will work through a hands-on exercise using the ‘dplyr’ and ‘dbplyr’ packages for R to access data in an SQL database.\nHowever, some links to introductory resources on SQL will be added to this page in the near future for your future reference, given that SQL and databases is not currently covered in any of the other HDAT courses.\nYou need to bring (or be using) your laptop, have R and RStudio installed, and have the dplyr package installed (or better, the entire tidyverse meta-package).\nFurther instructions for the hands-on session\nIn the hands-on session, we wil be running the following code in this gist. Don’t run it yet! You will need to create a new project in RStudio, access the code in the gist and coy-and-paste it into a new R code window in RStudio. We will then step through it section by section.\nCode gist for Chapter 1 hands-on session\nThe HTML slide deck which was made using the Xaringan package for R was rendered to PDF using the method documented here.\nThe slide deck in HTML (web) format for the session can be accessed  here (or as a  PDF).\nChapter 1 assessment exercise\nFor chapter 1, the assessment exercise is very easy, and is designed to get you used to completing assessments using git and GitHub.\nMake sure you have installed git on your computer and that you have a GitHub account, as explained in the pre-recorded lectures and tutorials on git (see above), and that git is configured in RStudio.\nThen you can click on this link to the Chapter 1 assessment GitHub Classroom repository: https://classroom.github.com/a/4J9wKhgK\nThis will create a new GitHub repository for you, just for this assignment. Only you and the course instructors can access it, it is not public.\nYou should then clone this assignment repository to your local computer, using RStudio (or other git interfaces such as GitHub Desktop if you prefer). Complete the assignment (assessment task) according to the instructions given, save and commit your work to your local git repository, and then push that work back to the remote GitHub repository for the assessment (this should all be automatically set up when you clone the repo in RStudio).\nYou may revise your assessment task(s) as many times as you wish. We will mark the last committed version that you push to the GitHub repository for your chapter assessment by the due date.\nRequesting early marking\nYou may request early marking of your submitted assessment by following the steps outlined here.\nReadings and Resources for Chapter 1\n\n\nCore readings\n\n\nJennifer Bryan (2018) Excuse Me, Do You Have a Moment to Talk About Version Control?, The American Statistician, 72:1, 20-27\n\n\n\n\n\nOther resources\n\n\nAn excellent presentation on git and GitHub by Dr Mark Hanly, with a set of exercises on using git on the command line starting at slide 40 (HTML and PDF versions)\n\n\n \n\n\nTutorial provided by RStudio on using dplyr with external databases\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should prioritise the core readings each week.\n\n\n\n",

Effective communication across different media types is essential. Appropriate data visualisation techniques can greatly enhance communication and increase the effectiveness of communication. Data visualisation is an essential part of every data analysis. Increasingly the scientific community has become aware of problems regarding lack of transparency and reproducibility, and the use of fully reproducible methods of working are now essential.\nThis course takes a toolbox approach to creating appropriate, reproducible and transparent analyses and visualisations, and communicating them via various channels and modes, including informal and formal written communication, online communication and via interactive applications. In the context of R, it presents useful best-practice data science analysis and visualisation techniques with a focus on different types of data visualisations.\nThis course was originally developed in 2018 by Dr James Farrow and Dr Tim Churches. It was co-presented by James and Tim in 2018 and 2019, and co-presented by James and Tim in entirely online form in 2020, and by Tim and Andy Blance in 2021. Although the core material for the course remains substantially unchanged, a great deal of additional material was added in 2021, and for 2022 some further topics will be covered.\nThe original course introduction recorded by Dr James Farrow appears below, and is still valid - we have not removed anything from the core curriculum, although quite a lot of the material has been updated or supplemented to reflect recent developments. The additional material added in 2021 and 2022 will be covered in the interactive sessions on Thursday afternoons/evenings in the Term 2 2022 running of the course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse Schedule Term 2 2022\n\nLinks to slides and recordings will be posted on the page for each (weekly) chapter throughout the course.\nFor Term 2 2022, the course is provided in both blended (hydrid) and online formats. Each Chapter, which corresponds to a week in the ten week course, comprises pre-recorded lectures, interactive tutorials which student work through themselves, and a weekly interactive tutorial session. These tutorial sessions are provided in both online and face-to-face form (on teh UNSW Kensington campus).\nThere is a web page for each chapter (week) of the course, setting out exactly what you need to do each week (see links in the Course Schedule table below).\n\n\nWeek\n\n\nWeek starting\n\n\nCore topic(s)\n\n\nAdditional topic(s)\n\n\nlearnr tutorial\n\n\nOnline Tutorial\n\n\nFace-to-Face Tutorial\n\n\nChapter web page\n\n\nTutorial recordings\n\n\nWeek 1\n\n\nMon 30 May\n\n\nCourse Introduction; What is Data Visualisation; Introduction to R; Introduction to git\n\n\nIntroductions; dplyr and the R tidyverse; computer architecture, databases, SQL and accessing databases from R; hands-on exercise\n\n\n\n\n\n6:00pm-8:30pm (online), Wed 1 Jun\n\n\n2:00pm-4:30pm (F2F), Thur 2 Jun\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 2\n\n\nMon 06 June\n\n\nIntroduction to Literate Programming\n\n\nCommunication by self-publishing; hands-on setting up your own health data science blog\n\n\n\n\n\n6:00pm-8:30pm (online), Wed 8 Jun\n\n\n2:00pm-4:30pm (F2F), Thur 9 Jun\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 3\n\n\nMon 13 June\n\n\nConstructing Charts using ggplot2\n\n\nSome more visualisation theory; more on data visualisation using ggplot2\n\n\n\n\n\n6:00pm-8:30pm (online), Wed 15 Jun\n\n\n2:00pm-4:30pm (F2F), Thur 16 Jun\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 4\n\n\nMon 20 June\n\n\nCollaborative Report Writing (including tables)\n\n\nVisualisation with Python – guest tutorial by Dr Georgina Kennedy\n\n\n\n\n\n6:00pm-8:30pm (online), Wed 22 Jun\n\n\n2:00pm-4:30pm (F2F), Thur 23 Jun\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 5\n\n\nMon 27 June\n\n\nVisualisation and Mapping part 1\n\n\nTheories of Visual Perception – guest tutorial by Andy Blance; a visualisation I am proud of (Dr Malcolm Gillies)\n\n\n\n\n\n6:00pm-8:30pm (online), Wed 29 Jun\n\n\n2:00pm-4:30pm (F2F), Thur 30 Jun\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 6\n\n\nMon 04 July\n\n\nBuilding Interactive Data-driven Web Apps using Shiny part 1\n\n\nVisualisation and exploratory data analysis; visualisation of statistical models\n\n\n\n\n\n6:00pm-8:30pm (online), Wed 6 Jul\n\n\n2:00pm-4:30pm (F2F), Thur 7 Jul\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 7\n\n\nMon 11 July\n\n\nVisualisation and Mapping part 2\n\n\nIncorporating time – uses and misuses of animation in data visualisation; accessibility aspects of visualisation\n\n\n\n\n\n6:00pm-8:30pm (online), Wed 13 Jul\n\n\n2:00pm-4:30pm (F2F), Thur 14 Jul\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 8\n\n\nMon 18 July\n\n\nBuilding Interactive Data-driven Web Apps using Shiny part 2\n\n\nVisualisation of categorical data; visualising big data; a visualisation I am proud of (guest presentation)\n\n\n\n\n\n6:00pm-8:30pm (online), Wed 20 Jul\n\n\n2:00pm-4:30pm (F2F), Thur 21 Jul\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 9\n\n\nMon 25 July\n\n\nBuilding Interactive Data-driven Web Apps using Shiny part 3\n\n\nCommunicating COVID-19 models through Markdown documents, web sites, pre-print papers and Shiny apps – guest presentation by Dr Mark Hanly\n\n\n\n\n\n6:00pm-8:30pm (online), Wed 27 Jul\n\n\n2:00pm-4:30pm (F2F), Thur 28 Jul\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 10\n\n\nMon 01 August\n\n\nCourse Review and Group Project Presentations\n\n\nVisualising higher dimensions – uses and misuses of 3D graphics; dimensionality reduction techniques, including guest presentation by Dr Meg Stevens on visualising NLP models\n\n\n\n\n\n6:00pm-8:30pm (online), Wed 3 Aug\n\n\n2:00pm-4:30pm (F2F), Thur 4 Aug\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeams Space\nDiscussions, questions and online tutorials will be hosted in the course Teams Space which you can access here.\n\nWeekly interactive tutorials\nA weekly interactive tutorial session is offered, in both online and face-to-face formats. The material covered in both formats is identical. Each tutorial starts with a question-and-answer sessions on the core curriculum material for that and previous weeks, and then goes on to cover additional material, usually a mixture of short lectures or presentations and a hands-on practical exercise. Some weeks feature a guest presenter (see details in the course schedule table below and on each course chapter page).\nAttendance at tutorial sessions is optional but strongly encouraged. However, we recognise that some students may not be able to attend either the online or the face-to-face sessions due to work, family or other commitments. For those students, the online sessions will be recorded and available the next day for viewing at their convenience.\n\nInternational students who have enrolled in the course for blended/hybrid delivery and who are on a student visa, are required to attend at least 3 hours per week of face-to-face classes on campus for each course to meet your visa requirements. Such students should make every effort to attend the face-to-face classes. If you are such a student, but you can’t make it to one of the face-to-face sessions, please just let me know by email at timothy.churches@unsw.edu.au so I can keep a record of why.\nThe online interactive tutorials will be held using Teams at 6pm (Sydney time) each Wednesday. The tutorial will usually last between 2 and 2.5 hours. You can join the tutorials using this link. These tutorials should also appear in your Teams calendar.\nThe face-to-face interactive tutorials will be held on the UNSW Kensingtom campus in the Mathews 104 room (K-F23-104) starting at 2pm each Thursday. These tutorials will also usually last between 2 and 2.5 hours. It may not be possible for all guest presenters to attend these tutorials in person, in which case the presentations may be provided online or students may view the recorded online tutorial for those parts of the tutorial. Please bring your laptop to these tutorials.\nThe tutorials R packages\nOnline, hosted versions of the learnr tutorials for this course can be accessed through the links in the Course Schedule table above, but it is better to use a local copy that you can work on in the RStudio environment without the need for internet access. You will need a copy of R and RStudio running on your computer in order to participate in the interactive (face-to-face or online) tutorial sessions held each Thursday, and to complete and submit assignments.\nIf you do not already have R and RStudio installed, please follow the instructions on the Installing R page. If you have any problems or questions please contact the course convenor Tim Churches on teams of by email at timothy.churches@unsw.edu.au.\nOnce installed, the tutorials can be accessed via the Tutorial tab in the upper right-hand pane of the RStudio application window.\nThe tutorials for Chapter 1 are shipped in the package cbdrhintro. To install this package you can enter the following code at the console:\n\n\ndevtools::install_github(\"CBDRH/cbdrhintro\")\n\n\n\nYou may get prompted to update some packages. You can chose to ignore this by selecting option 3 (None).\n\nIf you choose to update packages, you may subsequently be asked if you want to install binary or source versions. Source versions require special tools to compile which you may not have configured, so you should choose to install the binary version, i.e. if prompted Do you want to install from sources the packages which need compilation? enter n for ‘No’.\nThe package installation can occasionally fail, usually if there is a dependency that is not installed or has an outdated version. If you get an error message relating to a package, try installing that package first and then try again. If there are still issues, don’t worry, just drop an email to the course convenor.\nPlease note: if you have installed the cbdrhintro previously, you will need to re-install it again because we have added a tutorial for dplyr required for Chapter 1 of this course.\nThe tutorials for Chapters 2 onwards are shipped in the package hdat9800tutorials. To install this package you can enter the following code at the console:\n\n\ndevtools::install_github(\"CBDRH/hdat9800\")\n\n\n\nYou may need to re-install this package from time to time as instructed to receive updates to the tutorials.\n\nBack to the top \n\nAssessments\nWeekly core curriculum assessments\nThere are weekly individual assessments for Chapters 1 to 7. Each of these assessments is worth 8% of the total marks for the course, thus 56% all together. These weekly assessments cover the core course material and should be fairly easy and will not take very long to complete if you have worked through the core curriculum material. The weekly assessments must be submitted for marking no later than three weeks after the opening date for the chapter they relate to – the exact dates for each are shown in the table below. However, you are encouraged to submit the core curriculum assignments early, if possible, to allow more time for the additional assignments (see below). The course instructors will endeavour to mark and return assignments submitted before the due date as quickly as possible, so that you can get feedback and assurance on your progress and understanding of the course material.\nRequesting early marking\nYou may request early marking of your submitted core curriculum assessments by following the steps outlined here.\nAdditional assessments\nThere are also two additional assignments. These relate to topics covered in the Thursday tutorial sessions, but require additional independent research and some creativity to complete. Each is worth 7% of the total course marks, thus 14% all together. The exact dates on which each these are due is also shown in the table below. These assignments will be marked promptly after the due date for each.\n\nIn the 2021 running of this course we set these additional assessment tasks every week. However, feedback from students was that the assessment burden was too great and that they didn’t have time to do the additional assessments justice. Therefore we have reduced the number of these additional assessments to just two this year.\nGroup assessment\nIn week 6 of the course, you will be asked to form into small groups of 3 or 4 students each, to undertake a group assessment task. More details of this task will be provided in week 4 of the course. Each group will be required to present their group project in the Thursday sessions in week 10, and then submit all the code for the project in the week following that. The group assessment is worth 30% of the overall course marks.\nAssessment exercises timetable\n\n\nAssessment\n\n\nWeight\n\n\nDue date\n\n\nRepo link\n\n\nChapter 1 assessment\n\n\n8%\n\n\n9am, Mon 20 Jun\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 2 assessment\n\n\n8%\n\n\n9am, Mon 27 Jun\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional assessment A\n\n\n7%\n\n\n9am, Thur 14 Jul\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 3 assessment\n\n\n8%\n\n\n9am, Mon 4 Jul\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 4 assessment\n\n\n8%\n\n\n9am, Mon 11 Jul\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 5 assessment\n\n\n8%\n\n\n9am, Mon 18 Jul\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional assessment B\n\n\n7%\n\n\n9am, Thur 4 Aug\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 6 assessment\n\n\n8%\n\n\n9am, Mon 25 Jul\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 7 assessment\n\n\n8%\n\n\n9am, Mon 1 Aug\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup assessment\n\n\n30%\n\n\n9am, Mon 7 Aug\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick the link to clone a personal copy of the GitHub repo for each assessment. You will complete your assessment as an RMarkdown document, pushing it back to GitHub when you are ready to submit.\n\nReadings and resources\nThere are links to readings and additional resources on the page for each chapter of the course. You should prioritise the core readings each week.\nCourse Textbook\n\nClaus O. Wilke. Fundamentals of Data Visualization. O’Reilly Media, Sebestopol, CA. 2019. ISBN 978-1-492-03108-6.\nThis is a great introduction to data visualisation in the biological and biomedical sciences (the author is a biologist). Furthermore, it uses R throughout, and the entire text is itself written using literate programming methods in R! Best of all, it is available under a Creative Commons license and thus can be accessed and used without cost. By all means buy the published version (I have a copy), but you don’t have to – the full textbook can be accessed online. You can even access the source code for it.\nStarting with Chapter 2, there will be a set reading of part of the text each week which we will discuss in the interactive sessions. Don’t worry, the readings will not be very long.\nOther resources\nTo be updated shortly.\n\n\n\n",

Both R and RStudio are free, open-source software available at no cost and able to be installed on as many computers as you wish at no charge.\nR is a programming language and associated software libraries designed for statistical and data science computing. It is the “engine”, but provides only simple user interfaces. RStudio is an IDE (integrated development environment) application designed specifically for R although it works with other programming languages such as Python. It provides a very convenient and easy-to-use interface for working with R.\nFirst download R (choose the installation package appropriate for your computer’s operating system - Win/MacOS/Linux) from CRAN (the Comprehensive R Archive Network, which distributes R software worldwide via a series of mirror sites) at https://cloud.r-project.org. Download the R package appropriate for your computer’s operating system (Windows, Apple macOS or Linux) from the “Download and Install R” section at the top of the CRAN distribution page. Locate the downloaded package file in your downloads directory, and open it to run it. Just use the default settings for the installation.\nNext, download RStudio Desktop from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/. Select the free Open Source Edition. It should take you to this page. Download the package appropriate for your computer’s operating system (it should detect that and offer the correct package next to step 2. on the Rstudio downlaod page at https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download. Locate the downloaded file in your Downloads folder, open it to initiate the RStudio installation wizard.Again, just follow the installation default options offered.\nOpen RStudio - when it opens it should automatically detect and link to the R installation on your computer.\nYou can learn more about what’s available in RStudio Desktop here: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desktop\nYou will also need to install and configure git on your computer. This is covered in the tutorials on git and GitHub available on the Chapter 1 page for the HDAT9800 course.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nFor the Term 2 2022 running of the HDAT9800 course, we are offering early marking of core assignments (those for Chapters 1 to 7). This enables students to work at their own pace through the core curriculum material and the corresponding assessments, potentially leaving more time to work on the two additional assessments, the group assessment and otherwise engage with the additional material offered in each Chapter.\nIf you have completed a chapter assessment and submitted a final version of your solution to git, and pushed that to your assessment repo on GitHub (the repo that was automatically created for you when you clicked on the assignment link), then you can request early marking (before the assessment due date) by carrying out the steps listed below (it only takes a few seconds).\nNote: Requesting early marking is optional, and if you don’t request it, we will mark your asessments anyway, but not until after the due date for each assessment.\nIn your web browser, go to the repository for the assignment (GitHub will have sent you an email with a link to it, but it will also show up in your list of repositories if you log in to GitHub).\nClick on the Issues tab (highlighted in red in example screenshot below)\n\nYou should be at the issue page for the repo. Click on the New Issue button.\n\nThis will open a new issue form. Fill it out as shown below in the red highlighted ovals, with “Ready for marking” as the issue title, and @timchuches @OSotade as the body of the issue (that will make it show up in the course instructors open issues lists, see below). When you have filled those in, click the Submit new issue button as highlighted below.\n\nYou should see an open issue for your assessment repository that looks like the screenshot below. That’s all you need to do!\n\nThe issue you just opened will show up in the open issues list in GitHub for the course instructors (see below for an example). When your assessment has been marked, the instructors will close the issue with a comment that the assessment has been marked. You should receive an email notification about that automatically from GitHub.\nThis workflow is exactly what you would use if working with collaborators via git and GitHub – for example, on your group Assessment for this course!\n\nNote: Please don’t share your marks or comments on your marked assignment with fellow students until after the submission deadline for that assessment.\n\n\n\n",
