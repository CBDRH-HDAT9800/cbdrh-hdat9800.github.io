      "contents": "\nThis assessment is worth 14 marks (14% of the total marks for the\nHDAT9800 course).\nYour task is to create a dashboard which presents information of\ncurrent and past COVID infection and/or testing rates in NSW, using:\nthe flexdashboard package for R (see https://pkgs.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/ )\nNSW government data on COVID cases and testing, available at https://data.nsw.gov.au/nsw-covid-19-data\nnote that many of the COVID data series previously provided by the\nNSW government have been discontinued, but the following are still\navailable:\ncounts of COVID cases by date and geographic location\ncounts of COVID cases by date and age group\ncounts of negative PCR COVID tests by date an geographic\nlocation\n\n\nYou should clone the additional assignment repository from GitHub\nClassroom in the usual way using this URL: https://classroom.github.com/a/bFmZ23IU,\nand you should submit your assessment solution in the usual way by\ncommitting your work to git locally and then pushing that back to your\nassessment GitHuib repository, in exactly the same way as for the other\nassessments. You can, and should, commit your work often as it\nprogresses, and periodically push that back to GitHub. The version of\nyour work that has been pushed to GitHub by the due date and time for\nthis assessment will be the one which is marked. Please note that early\nmarking for this assessment is not offered.\nThe dashboard you create should have the following characteristics\n(with the number of marks awarded for each characteristic shown in\nbrackets):\nit should use at least two of the three NSW government COVID data\nfiles mentioned above (1.5 marks)\nit should automatically download (or otherwise use) the latest\nversion of those data files from the NSW government data web site (see\nURL above) each time the dashboard Rmd document is rendered (knitted)\n(1.5 marks)\nit should have three tabs or pages, each displaying a different\nchart visualising the NSW COVID data in a useful manner. That is, the\ndashboard should provide three charts or visualistions. You may provide\nadditional tabs or pages for documentation, but you should not create\nmore than three visualisations. The charts might be line charts, bar\ncharts, histograms, maps or any other type of chart that you can create\nusing the ggplot2 package and any extensions or add-ins for\nit. R packages for htmlwidgets (see https://www.htmlwidgets.org) may also be used. Each\nchart or visualisation should be accompanied by a brief explanation of\nwhat it is showing, although commentary or analysis of the current data\nis not required – in other words, explain in general terms what data\nyour visualsiations are displaying and how to interpret that\ninformation, but don’t write commentaries about the current trends or\npatterns in the data (as that may change by the time your dashboard is\nmarked). (3 marks will be awarded for each of the three charts or\nvisualisations, with 1.5 marks awarded for a basic but correct chart,\nand a further 1.5 marks for a well-executed chart with a good\nexplanation, improvements to its appearance over the default chart\nappearance, and/or additional features) (9 marks all together)\ntwo additional marks will be awarded if one of the charts is either\nanimated or includes some useful interactive aspect. There is no need to\ndo both animated and interactive charts, no extra marks\nwill be awarded for both (but no marks will be deducted if you do\nboth).\nmarks will be deducted for charts or visualisation which lack proper\nlabelling of axes and legends and which do not have informative\ntitles.\nThis is an individual assignment and must be your own work. However,\nstudents are encouraged to assist each other by sharing information or\nresources which help in completing the assessment. Students are also\nencouraged to seek help (including suggestions for type of charts etc)\nfrom the course instructors via Teams. The instructors are happy to\nclarify these instructions if required – this assessment exercise is\nintended to be open-ended and not too prescriptive, and thus not every\naspect has or can be described or specified exhaustively here. Any\nclarification given to one student will be shared with all via\nTeams.\nThis assessment task is new for 2022. It is inspired by the dashboard\nwhich one of the course instructors created in 2020 at the beginning of\nthe COVID pandemic – see https://cbdrh.github.io/ozcoviz/ – feel free to borrow\nideas from that example and to inspect its source code for help with\nimplementation (but note that it uses several different data sources).\nDo not copy code directly from it, though.\n\n\n\n",

It also provides\nan introduction to the core curriculum material for each of the chapter\ntopics including an introduction to R, dplyr, literate programming, git,\nggplot2, collaborating with git, using leaflet for mapping, using shiny\nfor interactive applications, and the shiny group project (Chapter 1 -\nCourse Overview - Part 2).\nThere is also an introduction to using git for version control\n(Chapter 1 - Version control with git and GitHub - Part 1), and how to\nset up and configure git with RStudio, how to access the assessment\nrepository and the chapter 1 assessment (Chapter 1 - Version control\nwith git and GitHub - Part 2).\nView the lecture videos, and download the lecture notes if you want\nto follow along with the presenter (or for revision later).\nAfter you have viewed the lectures, please proceed to do the\nlearnr tutorials on git.\nThere is also an interactive learnr tutorial covering\ndata manipulation using dplyr in R. This is also\nfoundational material for later chapters, which will require the use of\ndplyr and related packages to manipulate and shape data for\nvisualisation and reporting.\nThe interactive tutorial session for Chapter 1 will start with a\nget-to-know-you session, in which we each introduce ourselves, and talk\nabout our favourite data visualisation or chart (see below). There will\nbe an opportunity for questions and answers (Q&A) about the core\ncourse material, and then a hands-on session in which we use the\ndplyr package in R to access and manipulate data in\ndatabases, along with a discussion of some fundamental concepts of\ncomputer architecture and operations which are important to understand\nwhen working with “big data”.\nLinks and further instructions for each component are provided in the\nsections below.\nPre-recorded lectures for\nChapter 1\nView the lecture videos below, and download the lecture notes if you\nwant to follow along with the presenter (or for revision later).\nAfter you have viewed the lectures, please proceed to do the related\ngit tutorials (see below).\nCourse overview including course aims and principles\n(Chapter 1 - Course Overview - Part 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction of chapter topics including R,\ndplyr, literate programming, git,\nggplot2, collaborating with git,\nleaflet, shiny and the shiny group project\n(Chapter 1 - Course Overview - Part 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSlide deck\nfor Chapter 1 - Course Overview - Parts 1 & 2\nUsing git for version control (Chapter 1 -\nVersion control with git and GitHub - Part\n1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting up and configuring git, setting up\ngit with RStudio, how to access the assessment\nrepository and the chapter 1 assessment (Chapter 1 - Version control\nwith git and GitHub - Part 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSlide deck for\nChapter 1 - git and GitHub - Parts 1 & 2\nTutorials for Chapter 1\nEvery chapter includes one or more interactive tutorials/practicals,\nwhich consists of introductory concepts, readings and exercises,\ngenerally provided as an R package of learnr tutorials.\nlearnr is a package which allows interactive tutorials\nabout R (or related topics) to be written in\nR.\nYou should download and install the cbdrhintro tutorials\npackage for R by following the instructions provided on the\nhome page. Instructions for installing R and\nRStudio are provided here.\nThe Chapter 1 tutorials have three parts:\nIntroduction to R tutorials (proficient R\nusers can quickly run through or skip these tutorials, see the more\ndetailed description of these tutorials below)\nIntroduction to git and GitHub\nIntroduction to dplyr\nPlease work through the content in the tutorials after you have\nwatched the pre-recorded lecture for this chapter.\nIf you have any questions about the tutorials, or if you want to\nshare any useful resources or post insights, please post in the Teams\nspace for the course, in the channel for Chapter 1.\nIntroduction to R\nTutorials for Beginners\nR is fast becoming the industry standard programming\nlanguage for statistical data analysis. If this is your first exposure\nto R, we have created some beginner R modules\nto introduce you to the R language and to help you build\nsome basic programming skills.\nThe modules are delivered as 6 learnr tutorials as a\nR package called cbdrhintro. Each module\nconsists of explanatory text and coding examples. The tutorials are\ninteractive so you can write and run code to see how it works, then\ncheck your code against the provided solutions. The coding tasks in\nthese tutorial modules are not marked assessments, so don’t worry if you\nmake mistakes. Each module is organised into several subtopics, which\nare bookmarked making it easy to pause and return at a later time.\nModule 1: Introduction to R, variable types and operators\nModule 2: Vectors\nModule 3: Matrices, matrix arithmetic and lists\nModule 4: Data frames and Factors\nModule 5: Functions\nModule 6: Control structures and control-like structures\nWho should\ncomplete the Introduction to R modules?\nR programming is a major component of many of the UNSW\nHealth Data Science courses. Some of the R dependent\ncourses will include these same learnr tutorials as part of\nthe course content. If you have already worked through them, there is no\nneed to do them again (unless you wish to for revision purposes).\nHowever if you are completely new to programming or new to\nR, we recommend spending some time reviewing and practising\nthe lessons of these modules during the first few weeks of the HDAT9800\ncourse.\nFor some students, this will be a lot of material to cover. Don’t\npanic! The course (and the assessment due dates) are paced so that there\nis plenty of time to get to grips with the fundamentals of\nR programming. If you would like additional interactive\ntutorials covering the Introduction to R material or the opportunity to\nask questions about it individually or in small groups, please let me\nknow on Teams or at timothy.churches@unsw.edu.au.\nPlease follow the instructions for installing the\ncbdrhintro tutorials package for R on the course home page and proceed to do the\ndplyr tutorial. We will revisit and revise the use of\ndply in the interactive session, and examine how it can be\nused to access “big data” contained in databases, in the context of\nmodern computing architecture and operation.\nIf you are unfamiliar with R, you should also work through the six\nintroduction to R tutorials that are also contained in and installed by\nthat package.\nInteractive sessions for\nChapter 1\n\nIn the first interactive tutorial for the course, we will start off\nwith introductions. Your course instructors will introduce themselves\nand then each student will be requested to briefly talk about themselves\n(where you are from, what is your work/educational background, how much\nexperience you have had working with health or other data).\nWe would also like you to briefly present a data visualisation (by\nsomeone else) that you have found interesting, or persuasive, or even\njust beautiful. You only need to describe it for 30 seconds and tell us\nwhat about it interests you. It does not need to be health-related.\nDon’t spend too much time looking for something, it is not a marked\nexercise, and if you don’t have time to find something for this week,\ndon’t worry, we can show the visualisation you chose in later weeks. Be\nready to show it on your computer screen. We will create a page on the\ncourse web site to feature each of these as a lasting record.\nAfter these introductions, there will be an opportunity to ask\nquestions about the course, the assessments and the content for Chapter\n1. We will repeat this every week, and you can ask questions about\nearlier chapters at any time, of course.\nPlease note: Although a working knowledge of SQL is a valuable, or\nperhaps even an essential skill, for most data scientists, you are\nnot expected to acquire such skills as part of this\ncourse, and none of the assessments require knowledge or understanding\nof SQL.\nThen we will cover some additional material: there will be a brief\ntalk by Tim Churches on computer architecture, databases and big data,\nand then we will work through a hands-on exercise using the ‘dplyr’ and\n‘dbplyr’ packages for R to access data in an SQL database.\nHowever, some links to introductory resources on SQL will be added to\nthis page in the near future for your future reference, given that SQL\nand databases is not currently covered in any of the other HDAT\ncourses.\nYou need to bring (or be using) your laptop, have R and RStudio\ninstalled, and have the dplyr package installed (or better,\nthe entire tidyverse meta-package).\nFurther\ninstructions for the hands-on session\nIn the hands-on session, we will be running the following code in\nthis gist. Don’t run it yet! You will need to create a new\nproject in RStudio, access the code in the gist and\ncoy-and-paste it into a new R code window in RStudio. We will then step\nthrough it section by section.\nCode\ngist for Chapter 1 hands-on session\nThe HTML slide deck which was made using the Xaringan package for R\nwas rendered to PDF using the method documented here.\nThe slide deck in HTML (web) format for the session can be accessed\n\nhere (or as a\n\nPDF).\nA recording of the online interactive session for Chapter 1 is\navailable here.\nChapter 1 assessment\nexercise\nFor chapter 1, the assessment exercise is very easy, and is designed\nto get you used to completing assessments using git and\nGitHub.\nMake sure you have installed git on your computer and\nthat you have a GitHub account, as explained in the\npre-recorded lectures and tutorials on git (see above), and\nthat git is configured in RStudio.\nThen you can click on this link to the Chapter 1 assessment GitHub\nClassroom repository: https://classroom.github.com/a/4J9wKhgK\nThis will create a new GitHub repository for you, just for this\nassignment. Only you and the course instructors can access it, it is not\npublic.\nYou should then clone this assignment repository to your local\ncomputer, using RStudio (or other git interfaces such as GitHub Desktop\nif you prefer). Complete the assignment (assessment task) according to\nthe instructions given, save and commit your work to your local git\nrepository, and then push that work back to the remote\nGitHub repository for the assessment (this should all be\nautomatically set up when you clone the repo in RStudio).\nYou may revise your assessment task(s) as many times as you wish. We\nwill mark the last committed version that you push to the GitHub\nrepository for your chapter assessment by the due date.\nRequesting early marking\nYou may request early marking of your submitted assessment by\nfollowing the steps outlined here.\nReadings and Resources for\nChapter 1\n\n\nCore readings\n\n\nJennifer Bryan (2018) Excuse Me, Do You Have a Moment to Talk About\nVersion Control?, The American Statistician, 72:1, 20-27\n\n\n\n\n\nOther resources\n\n\nAn excellent presentation on git and GitHub by Dr Mark Hanly, with a set\nof exercises on using git on the command line starting at slide 40 (HTML\nand PDF versions)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTutorial provided by RStudio on using dplyr with external databases\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should prioritise the core readings each week.\n\n\n\n",

The distill package for R (and its\ndependencies, which will automatically be installed too) will be needed.\nIf possible, you should install that before the session.\nThe session will not go as long as the Chapter 1 session, and we will\ntake a break for 5 minutes every hour!\nThe slide deck in HTML (web) format for the session can be accessed\n\nhere (or as a\n\nPDF).\nNote: We have provided an additional video below\nwhich more clearly illustrates the steps required to set up a blog web\nsite using distill. Therefore we recommend that you watch\nthe video of the Chapter 2 online session, below, only up to the point\nat which creation of a blog site is demonstrated. At that point, watch\nthe additional video below instead.\nA recording of the Chapter 2 online session is available here.\nThere is an additional video which illustrates each of the steps in\ncreating a blog site:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolving problems with\nGitHub access\nWhen attempting to set up a blog site on GitHub, you may encounter\nerrors relating to authenticating to GitHub. This is because GitHub now\nrequires the use of PATs (personal access tokens) to\nauthenticate to repositories, rather than passwords (you still need your\nGitHub account password to access the GitHub website, so don’t lose\nthat!). A PAT only needs to be set up once in RStudio to enable you to\nuse the git and GitHub tools built into RStudio. To do this, follow the\nsteps in sections 9.1, 9.3 and 9.4 of (this guide by Jenny Bryan)[https://happygitwithr.com/https-pat.html]. Section 9.2\ncontains additional details about HTTPS vs SSH authentication which you\ndon’t need to detail with – just use HTTPS. If you need additional help,\nplease contact the course instructors via email or Teams, we are very\nhappy to help.\nChapter 2 assessment\nexercise\nFor Chapter 2, the assessment exercise is slightly more involved than\nChapter 1, and is intended to give you some practice editing Rmarkdown\ndocuments.

Your group only needs to do\none of them, A or B, not both!\nGroup Project A is similar to the group project in previous years for\nthis course. It involves building a fairly sophisticated shiny app. Much\nof the code is provided, but not all of it. There are detailed\ninstructions. We recommend this project for students who are relatively\nnew to programming in general, or programming in R specifically. The\nproject provides a clear framework for what you are supposed to do.\nGroup Project B is intended for students who have a more extensive\nbackground in coding and are looking for a creative challenge. The task\nis very open-ended, and there are many aspects in\nmeeting the challenge which will require thought and investigation.\nBoth Project A and Project B offer the same marks. However, to\nachieve full marks or close to full marks in Project A, the submitted\nsolution will need to be flawless in all respects. In previous years,\nthe best groups scored 27 or 28 out of 30 marks, with most groups\nscoring in the low 20s. By contrast, marking for Project B will focus\nmore on the innovative or novel aspects of the submitted assessment.\nBecause there are no detailed marking rubrics for the group\nassessment, all group assessments will be dual-marked independently by\nboth course instructors (Tim and Dami), and the average of the two marks\nwill be awarded.\nGroup Project A\nYour task is to build a shiny app showcasing some of the things we\nhave been learning about this term.\nA description of the project is contained in the\nREADME.Rmd file (which has also been rendered as an HTML\nfile, available here in\nthe assignment starter repository. Make sure you read it.\nThis is a collaborative assignment using git and you must use git to\ndo it. You cannot copy files around using USB sticks or send them to\neach other via email. You will lose marks for doing so. There must be\nevidence of collaboration using git.\nYou may like to revise the tutorial on conflicts in the Introduction\nto git tutorial package.\nGroup Project B\nThis alternative project is very open-ended and is intended for\ngroups of students with a greater coding background who want more of a\ncreative and/or coding challenge.\nYou task is to create some novel or innovative visualisations of some\naspect or aspects of the recently-released 2021 Australian Census data,\nwhich is available via the ABS (Australian Bureau of Statistics) web\nsite.\nNote that there are **many* web sites providing dashboard-like access\nwith fairly standard bar charts and other visualisations of these Census\ndata. You should not attempt to replicate any of these. You do not have\nto provide a comprehensive visualisation facility for the Census data.\nInstead, aim for something novel or innovative. It may be interactive,\nor it may be static.\nAn example of a suitable project might be to use the DataShader\nlibrary for python, to create zoomable, ultra-detailed maps of all of\nAustralia (or a whole state such as NSW), where each person in the\npopulation is represented as a point with a colour shading representing\nsome value (eg age, income, educational level etc). Census data do not\ncontain such individual data, so you would need to synthesise individual\ndata at the SA1 geographic level from the summary (tabular) counts of\npeople, and then assign random geographic coordinates for each\nindividual with the boundaries of the SA1 geographic area to which they\nbelong.\nIf your group chooses Project B, please discuss your\nintended project with the course instructors (via Teams) before getting\nstarted, to ensure your goals are not too ambitious, nor too\nconstrained.\nMarking will reflect the novelty or innovative nature of the project\nsolution, as well as the success of the execution. Novel or innovative\nsolutions can expect high marks.\nYou do not have to use R for Project B. Python is also acceptable, as\nis JavaScript or any other open-source languge and tools. Mixed\nprogramming languages are fine. However, proprietary software should not\nbe used. The instructors need to be able to run your solution on heir\nlaptops (which are quite powerful with 16 or 32GB of RAM) without having\nto purchase any software licenses.\nYou should submit your assignment using this same repository, but you\nmay delete all the files related to Project A from it.\nHow to\nform a project group (groups of 3 or 4 student)\nYou should form yourselves into groups of 3 or 4 for this assignment.\nAt a pinch a group of two may be possible but it will mean more work for\nyou aand is not recommended. It will not be possible to do this in\ngroups of more than four or to do this assignment individually.\nThe group members should choose a (unique) name for themselves and\nelect one person to start a group by using the GitHub Classroom link to\nstart the group and give it a name. Once the assignment group is created\nthe remaining members can join the project. At that point it’s just a\nregular git project: everyone should clone their own copy and work on\nthe assignment together by working on their sections and pushing and\npulling commits to GitHub.\nPlease ensure you have found partners and formed your groups by 29\nJuly 2022.\nGroup Project Github\nRepository\nThe GitHub Classroom link for this project is https://classroom.github.com/a/o4mZXeEU\nOptional Demonstration\nThere will be an opportunity to talk about and/or demonstrate your\ngroup assignment project, or ask advice, during the online and\nface-to-face sessions for Week 10. Presentation or demonstration is\nentirely optional and you and your group will not be penalised if you\nchose not to present. In previous years, part of the group assignment\ninvolved a short (marked) presentation on how you approached your task\nand what it showed. However, in view of the current COVID-19\nrestrictions and the difficulties of hosting such group presentation\nonline, we have decided to drop this aspect of the assessment. Last year\nwe tried video presentations during similar COVID-19 lockdown\nrestrictions, but they were not entirely successful and created a lot of\nextra work, and stress, for students and instructors alike.\nGroup Project Deadline\nYour final group project is due by Friday 19th August 2022 9am.\nThe version on GitHub at this time will be deemed to be your\nsolution.\n\n\n\n",

Effective communication across different media types is\nessential. Appropriate data visualisation techniques can greatly enhance\ncommunication and increase the effectiveness of communication. Data\nvisualisation is an essential part of every data analysis. Increasingly\nthe scientific community has become aware of problems regarding lack of\ntransparency and reproducibility, and the use of fully reproducible\nmethods of working are now essential.\nThis course takes a toolbox approach to creating appropriate,\nreproducible and transparent analyses and visualisations, and\ncommunicating them via various channels and modes, including informal\nand formal written communication, online communication and via\ninteractive applications. In the context of R, it presents useful\nbest-practice data science analysis and visualisation techniques with a\nfocus on different types of data visualisations.\nThis course was originally developed in 2018 by Dr James Farrow and\nDr Tim Churches. It was co-presented by James and Tim in 2018 and 2019,\nand co-presented by James and Tim in entirely online form in 2020, and\nby Tim and Andy Blance in 2021. Although the core material for the\ncourse remains substantially unchanged, a great deal of additional\nmaterial was added in 2021, and for 2022 some further topics will be\ncovered.\nThe original course introduction recorded by Dr James Farrow appears\nbelow, and is still valid - we have not removed anything from the core\ncurriculum, although quite a lot of the material has been updated or\nsupplemented to reflect recent developments. The additional material\nadded in 2021 and 2022 will be covered in the interactive sessions on\nThursday afternoons/evenings in the Term 2 2022 running of the\ncourse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse Schedule Term 2 2022\n\nLinks to slides and recordings will be posted on the page for each\n(weekly) chapter throughout the course.\nFor Term 2 2022, the course is provided in both blended (hybrid) and\nonline formats. Each Chapter, which corresponds to a week in the eleven\nweek course (plus one low-activity week for reading and catch-up),\ncomprises pre-recorded lectures, interactive tutorials which student\nwork through themselves, and a weekly interactive tutorial session.\nThese tutorial sessions are provided in both online and face-to-face\nform (on the UNSW Kensington campus).\nThere is a web page for each chapter of the course, setting out\nexactly what you need to do each week (see links in the Course Schedule\ntable below).\n\n\nWeek\n\n\nWeek starting\n\n\nChapter\n\n\nCore topic(s)\n\n\nAdditional topic(s)\n\n\nlearnr tutorial\n\n\nOnline Tutorial\n\n\nFace-to-Face Tutorial\n\n\nChapter web page\n\n\nTutorial recordings\n\n\nWeek 1\n\n\nMon 30 May\n\n\nCh 1\n\n\nCourse Introduction; What is Data Visualisation; Introduction to R;\nIntroduction to git\n\n\nIntroductions; dplyr and the R tidyverse; computer architecture,\ndatabases, SQL and accessing databases from R; hands-on exercise\n\n\n\n\n\n6:00pm-8:30pm (online), Wed 1 Jun\n\n\n2:00pm-4:30pm (F2F), Thur 2 Jun\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 2\n\n\nMon 06 June\n\n\nCh 2\n\n\nIntroduction to Literate Programming\n\n\nCommunication by self-publishing; hands-on setting up your own health\ndata science blog\n\n\n\n\n\n6:00pm-8:30pm (online), Wed 8 Jun\n\n\n2:00pm-4:30pm (F2F), Thur 9 Jun\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 3\n\n\nMon 13 June\n\n\nCh 3\n\n\nConstructing Charts using ggplot2\n\n\nSome more visualisation theory; more on data visualisation using ggplot2\n\n\n\n\n\n6:00pm-8:30pm (online), Wed 15 Jun\n\n\n2:00pm-4:30pm (F2F), Thur 16 Jun\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 4\n\n\nMon 20 June\n\n\nCh 4\n\n\nCollaborative Report Writing (including tables)\n\n\nVisualisation with Python – guest tutorial by Dr Georgina Kennedy\n\n\n\n\n\n6:00pm-8:30pm (online), Wed 22 Jun\n\n\n2:00pm-4:30pm (F2F), Thur 23 Jun\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 5\n\n\nMon 27 June\n\n\nCh 5\n\n\nVisualisation and Mapping part 1\n\n\nTheories of Visual Perception – guest tutorial by Andy Blance; a\nvisualisation I am proud of (Dr Malcolm Gillies)\n\n\n\n\n\n6:00pm-8:30pm (online), Wed 29 Jun\n\n\n2:00pm-4:30pm (F2F), Thur 30 Jun\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 6\n\n\nMon 04 July\n\n\n\n\nLow activity week\n\n\nGuest lecture by Prof Louisa Jorm on communicating with non-technical\naudiences; hands-on ggplot2 practice coding\n\n\n\n\n\n6:00pm-8:30pm (online), Wed 6 Jul\n\n\n2:00pm-4:30pm (F2F), Thur 7 Jul\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 7\n\n\nMon 11 July\n\n\nCh 6\n\n\nBuilding Interactive Data-driven Web Apps using Shiny part 1\n\n\nIncorporating time – uses and misuses of animation in data\nvisualisation; accessibility aspects of visualisation, more hands-on\nggplot2 coding exercises\n\n\n\n\n\n6:00pm-8:30pm (online), Wed 13 Jul\n\n\n2:00pm-4:30pm (F2F), Thur 14 Jul\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 8\n\n\nMon 18 July\n\n\nCh 7\n\n\nVisualisation and Mapping part 2\n\n\nVisualisation of categorical data; visualising big data, yet more\nggplot2 coding explorations\n\n\n\n\n\n6:00pm-8:30pm (online), Wed 20 Jul\n\n\n2:00pm-4:30pm (F2F), Thur 21 Jul\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 9\n\n\nMon 25 July\n\n\nCh 8\n\n\nBuilding Interactive Data-driven Web Apps using Shiny part 2\n\n\nCommunicating COVID-19 models through Markdown documents, web sites,\npre-print papers and Shiny apps – guest presentation by Dr Mark Hanly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6:00pm-8:30pm (online), Wed 27 Jul\n\n\n2:00pm-4:30pm (F2F), Thur 28 Jul\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 10\n\n\nMon 01 August\n\n\nCh 9\n\n\nBuilding Interactive Data-driven Web Apps using Shiny part 3\n\n\nVisualising higher dimensions – uses and misuses of 3D graphics;\ndimensionality reduction techniques, including a guest presentation by\nDr Nic Kuo on t-SNE dimensionality reduction for visualising NLP models\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6:00pm-8:30pm (online), Wed 3 Aug\n\n\n2:00pm-4:30pm (F2F), Thur 4 Aug\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 11\n\n\nMon 08 August\n\n\nCh 10\n\n\nCourse Review and Group Project Presentations\n\n\n(Optional) group project presentations; other material by request\n(things we have missed)\n\n\n\n\n\n6:00pm-8:30pm (online), Wed 10 Aug\n\n\n2:00pm-4:30pm (F2F), Thur 11 Aug\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeams Space\nDiscussions, questions and online tutorials will be hosted in the\ncourse Teams Space which you can access here.\n\nWeekly interactive tutorials\nA weekly interactive tutorial session is offered, in both online and\nface-to-face formats. The material covered in both formats is identical.\nEach tutorial starts with a question-and-answer sessions on the core\ncurriculum material for that and previous weeks, and then goes on to\ncover additional material, usually a mixture of short lectures or\npresentations and a hands-on practical exercise. Some weeks feature a\nguest presenter (see details in the course schedule table below and on\neach course chapter page).\nAttendance at tutorial sessions is optional but strongly encouraged.\nHowever, we recognise that some students may not be able to attend\neither the online or the face-to-face sessions due to work, family or\nother commitments. For those students, the online sessions will be\nrecorded and available the next day for viewing at their\nconvenience.\n\nInternational students who have enrolled in the course for\nblended/hybrid delivery and who are on a student visa,\nare required to attend at least 3 hours per week of\nface-to-face classes on campus for each course to meet your visa\nrequirements. Such students should make every effort to attend the\nface-to-face classes. If you are such a student, but you can’t make it\nto one of the face-to-face sessions, please just let me know by email at\ntimothy.churches@unsw.edu.au so I can keep a record of\nwhy.\nThe online interactive tutorials will be held using Teams at 6pm\n(Sydney time) each Wednesday. The tutorial will usually last between 2\nand 2.5 hours. You can join the tutorials using this\nlink. These tutorials should also appear in your Teams calendar.\nThe face-to-face interactive tutorials will be held on the UNSW\nKensington campus in the Mathews 104 room (K-F23-104) starting at 2pm\neach Thursday. These tutorials will also usually last between 2 and 2.5\nhours. It may not be possible for all guest presenters to attend these\ntutorials in person, in which case the presentations may be provided\nonline or students may view the recorded online tutorial for those parts\nof the tutorial. Please bring your laptop to these tutorials.\nThe tutorials R packages\nOnline, hosted versions of the learnr tutorials for this\ncourse can be accessed through the links in the Course Schedule table\nabove, but it is better to use a local copy that you can work on in the\nRStudio environment without the need for internet access.\nYou will need a copy of R and RStudio running on your computer in order\nto participate in the interactive (face-to-face or online) tutorial\nsessions held each Thursday, and to complete and submit assignments.\nIf you do not already have R and RStudio installed, please follow the\ninstructions on the Installing R page.\nIf you have any problems or questions please contact the course convenor\nTim Churches on teams of by email at timothy.churches@unsw.edu.au.\nOnce installed, the tutorials can be accessed via the\nTutorial tab in the upper right-hand pane of the\nRStudio application window.\nThe tutorials for Chapter 1 are shipped in the package\ncbdrhintro. To install this package you can enter the\nfollowing code at the console:\n\n\ndevtools::install_github(\"CBDRH/cbdrhintro\")\n\n\n\nYou may get prompted to update some packages. You can chose to ignore\nthis by selecting option 3 (None).\n\nIf you choose to update packages, you may subsequently be asked if\nyou want to install binary or source versions. Source versions require\nspecial tools to compile which you may not have configured, so you\nshould choose to install the binary version, i.e. if prompted Do you\nwant to install from sources the packages which need compilation?\nenter n for ‘No’.\nThe package installation can occasionally fail, usually if there is a\ndependency that is not installed or has an outdated version. If you get\nan error message relating to a package, try installing that package\nfirst and then try again. If there are still issues, don’t worry, just\ndrop an email to the course convenor.\nPlease note: if you have installed the\ncbdrhintro previously, you will need to re-install it again\nbecause we have added a tutorial for dplyr required for\nChapter 1 of this course.\nThe tutorials for Chapters 2 onwards are shipped in the package\nhdat9800tutorials. To install this package you can enter\nthe following code at the console:\n\n\ndevtools::install_github(\"CBDRH/hdat9800\")\n\n\n\nYou may need to re-install this package from time to time as\ninstructed to receive updates to the tutorials.\n\nBack to the top\n\n\nAssessments\nWeekly core curriculum\nassessments\nThere are weekly individual assessments for Chapters 1 to 7. Each of\nthese assessments is worth 8% of the total marks for the course, thus\n56% all together. These weekly assessments cover the core course\nmaterial and should be fairly easy and will not take very long to\ncomplete if you have worked through the core curriculum material. The\nweekly assessments must be submitted for marking no later than three\nweeks after the opening date for the chapter they relate to – the exact\ndates for each are shown in the table below. However, you are encouraged\nto submit the core curriculum assignments early, if possible, to allow\nmore time for the additional assignments (see below). The course\ninstructors will endeavour to mark and return assignments submitted\nbefore the due date as quickly as possible, so that you can get feedback\nand assurance on your progress and understanding of the course\nmaterial.\nRequesting early marking\nYou may request early marking of your submitted core curriculum\nassessments by following the steps outlined here.\nAdditional assessment\nThere is also one additional assessment task. This relates to topics\ncovered in the Thursday tutorial sessions, but requires additional\nindependent research and some creativity to complete. It is worth 14% of\nthe total course marks. Details of the additional assessment task can be\nfound in the README file in the assessment repository, which you can\nclone using this URL: https://classroom.github.com/a/bFmZ23IU\nor on the additional assessment\ninformation page.\n\nIn the 2021 running of this course we set these additional assessment\ntasks every week. However, feedback from students was that the\nassessment burden was too great and that they didn’t have time to do the\nadditional assessments justice. Therefore we have reduced the number of\nthese additional assessments to just one this year, worth 14% of total\nmarks.\nGroup assessment\nIn week 7 of the course you will be asked to form into small groups\nof 3 or 4 students each, to undertake a group assessment task. More\ndetails of this task will be provided in week 6 of the course. Each\ngroup will be given the opportunity to present their group project in\nthe Wednesday (online) or Thursday face-to-face sessions in week 11\n(Chapter 10), but these presentations are optional and are not assessed.\nGroups must submit all the code for the project in the week following\nthat. The group assessment is worth 30% of the overall course marks.\nAssessment exercises\ntimetable\n\n\nAssessment\n\n\nWeight\n\n\nDue date\n\n\nRepo link\n\n\nChapter 1 assessment\n\n\n8%\n\n\n9am, Mon 20 Jun\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 2 assessment\n\n\n8%\n\n\n9am, Mon 27 Jun\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 3 assessment\n\n\n8%\n\n\n9am, Mon 4 Jul\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 4 assessment\n\n\n8%\n\n\n9am, Mon 11 Jul\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 5 assessment\n\n\n8%\n\n\n9am, Mon 25 Jul\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 6 assessment\n\n\n8%\n\n\n9am, Mon 1 Aug\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 7 assessment\n\n\n8%\n\n\n9am, Mon 8 Aug\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional individual assessment\n\n\n14%\n\n\n9am, Thu 11 Aug\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup assessment\n\n\n30%\n\n\n9am, Fri 19 Aug\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick the link to clone a personal copy of the GitHub repo for each\nassessment.

Furthermore, it\nuses R throughout, and the entire text is itself written\nusing literate programming methods in R! Best of all, it is available\nunder a Creative Commons license and thus can be accessed and used\nwithout cost. By all means buy the published version (I have a copy),\nbut you don’t have to – the full textbook can be accessed online. You can even\naccess the source code for it.\nStarting with Chapter 2, there will be a set reading of part of the\ntext each week which we will discuss in the interactive sessions. Don’t\nworry, the readings will not be very long.\nOther resources\nTo be updated shortly.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nTo participate in the HDAT9800 course you will need a copy of both\nR and RStudio installed on your computer. Both\nR and RStudio are free, open-source software\navailable at no cost and able to be installed on as many computers as\nyou wish at no charge.\nR is a programming language and associated software\nlibraries designed for statistical and data science computing. It is the\n“engine”, but provides only simple user interfaces. RStudio\nis an IDE (integrated development environment) application designed\nspecifically for R although it works with other programming\nlanguages such as Python. It provides a very convenient and easy-to-use\ninterface for working with R.\nFirst download R (choose the installation package\nappropriate for your computer’s operating system - Win/MacOS/Linux) from\nCRAN (the Comprehensive R Archive Network, which distributes R software\nworldwide via a series of mirror sites) at https://cloud.r-project.org.\nDownload the R package appropriate for your computer’s\noperating system (Windows, Apple macOS or Linux) from the “Download and\nInstall R” section at the top of the CRAN distribution page. Locate the\ndownloaded package file in your downloads directory, and open it to run\nit. Just use the default settings for the installation.\nNext, download RStudio Desktop from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/.\nSelect the free Open Source Edition. It should take you to this\npage. Download the package appropriate for your computer’s operating\nsystem (it should detect that and offer the correct package next to step\n2. on the Rstudio downlaod page at https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download.\nLocate the downloaded file in your Downloads folder, open it to initiate\nthe RStudio installation wizard.Again, just follow the installation\ndefault options offered.\nOpen RStudio - when it opens it should automatically\ndetect and link to the R installation on your computer.\nYou can learn more about what’s available in RStudio Desktop here: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desktop\nYou will also need to install and configure git on your\ncomputer. This is covered in the tutorials on git and\nGitHub available on the Chapter\n1 page for the HDAT9800 course.\n\n\n\n",

      "author": [],
      "contents": "\nFor the Term 2 2022 running of the HDAT9800 course, we are offering\nearly marking of core assignments (those for Chapters 1 to 7). This\nenables students to work at their own pace through the core curriculum\nmaterial and the corresponding assessments, potentially leaving more\ntime to work on the two additional assessments, the group assessment and\notherwise engage with the additional material offered in each\nChapter.\nIf you have completed a chapter assessment and submitted a final\nversion of your solution to git, and pushed that to your assessment repo\non GitHub (the repo that was automatically created for you when you\nclicked on the assignment link), then you can request early marking\n(before the assessment due date) by carrying out the steps listed below\n(it only takes a few seconds).\nNote: Requesting early marking is optional, and if\nyou don’t request it, we will mark your asessments anyway, but not until\nafter the due date for each assessment.\nIn your web browser, go to the repository for the assignment\n(GitHub will have sent you an email with a link to it, but it will also\nshow up in your list of repositories if you log in to GitHub).\nClick on the Issues tab (highlighted in red in example screenshot\nbelow)\n\nYou should be at the issue page for the repo. Click on the\nNew Issue button.\n\nThis will open a new issue form. Fill it out as shown below in the\nred highlighted ovals, with “Ready for marking” as the issue title, and\n@timchurches @OSotade as the body of the issue (that will\nmake it show up in the course instructors open issues lists, see below).\nWhen you have filled those in, click the Submit new\nissue button as highlighted below.\n\nYou should see an open issue for your assessment repository that\nlooks like the screenshot below. That’s all you need to do!\n\nThe issue you just opened will show up in the open issues list in\nGitHub for the course instructors (see below for an example). When your\nassessment has been marked, the instructors will close the issue with a\ncomment that the assessment has been marked. You should receive an email\nnotification about that automatically from GitHub.\nThis workflow is exactly what you would use if working with\ncollaborators via git and GitHub – for example, on your group Assessment\nfor this course!\n\nNote: Please don’t share your marks or comments on\nyour marked assignment with fellow students until after\nthe submission deadline for that assessment.\n\n\n\n",
