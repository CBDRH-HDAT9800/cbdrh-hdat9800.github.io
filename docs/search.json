Effective communication across different media types is essential. Appropriate data visualisation techniques can greatly enhance communication and increase the effectiveness of communication. Data visualisation is an essential part of every data analysis. Increasingly the scientific community has become aware of problems regarding lack of transparency and reproducibility, and the use of fully reproducible methods of working are now essential.\nThis course takes a toolbox approach to creating appropriate, reproducible and transparent analyses and visualisations, and communicating them via various channels and modes, including informal and formal written communication, online communication and via interactive applications. In the context of R, it presents useful best-practice data science analysis and visualisation techniques with a focus on different types of data visualisations.\nThis course was originally developed in 2018 by Dr James Farrow and Dr Tim Churches. It was presented by James in 2018 and 2019, and co-presented by James and Tim in entirely online form in 2020, and by Tim and Andy Blance in 2021. Although the core material for the course remains substantially unchanged, a great deal of additional material was added in 2021, and for 2022 some further topics will be covered.\nThe original course introduction recorded by Dr James Farrow appears below, and is still valid - we have not removed anything from the core curriculum, although quite a lot of the material has been updated or supplemented to reflect recent developments. The additional material added in 2021 and 2022 will be covered in the interactive sessions on Thursday afternoons/evenings in the Term 2 2022 running of the course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse Schedule Term 2 2022\n\nLinks to slides and recordings will be posted on the page for each (weekly) chapter throughout the course.\n\n\nWeek\n\n\nWeek starting\n\n\nCore topic(s)\n\n\nlearnr tutorial link\n\n\nAdditional topic(s)\n\n\nTutorial\n\n\nChapter web page\n\n\nTutorial recordings\n\n\nWeek 1\n\n\nMon 30 May\n\n\nCourse Introduction; What is Data Visualisation; Introduction to R; Introduction to git\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroductions; dplyr and the R tidyverse; computer architecture, databases, SQL and accessing databases from R; hands-on exercise\n\n\n2-4:30pm (F2F) & 5:30-8pm (online), Thur 2 Jun\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 2\n\n\nMon 06 June\n\n\nIntroduction to Literate Programming\n\n\n\n\n\nPresentations by program code; communication by self-publishing; hands-on setting up your own health data science blog; a visualisation I am proud of (guest presentation)\n\n\n2-4:30pm (F2F) & 5:30-8pm (online), Thur 9 Jun\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 3\n\n\nMon 13 June\n\n\nConstructing Charts using ggplot\n\n\n\n\n\nSome more visualisation theory; more on data visualisation using ggplot2\n\n\n2-4:30pm (F2F) & 5:30-8pm (online), Thur 16 Jun\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 4\n\n\nMon 20 June\n\n\nCollaborative Report Writing (including tables)\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualisation with Python – guest tutorial by Dr Georgina Kennedy\n\n\n2-4:30pm (F2F) & 5:30-8pm (online), Thur 23 Jun\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 5\n\n\nMon 27 June\n\n\nVisualisation and Mapping part 1\n\n\n\n\n\nTheories of Visual Perception – guest tutorial by Andy Blance; a visualisation I am proud of (guest presentation)\n\n\n2-4:30pm (F2F) & 5:30-8pm (online), Thur 30 Jun\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 6\n\n\nMon 04 July\n\n\nBuilding Interactive Data-driven Web Apps using Shiny part 1\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualisation and exploratory data analysis; visualisation of statistical models\n\n\nStudy period T2, no tutorial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 7\n\n\nMon 11 July\n\n\nVisualisation and Mapping part 2\n\n\n\n\n\nIncorporating time – uses and misuses of animation in data visualisation; accessibility aspects of visualisation\n\n\n2-4:30pm (F2F) & 5:30-8pm (online), Thur 14 Jul\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 8\n\n\nMon 18 July\n\n\nBuilding Interactive Data-driven Web Apps using Shiny part 2\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualisation of categorical data; visualising big data; a visualisation I am proud of (guest presentation)\n\n\n2-4:30pm (F2F) & 5:30-8pm (online), Thur 21 Jul\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 9\n\n\nMon 25 July\n\n\nBuilding Interactive Data-driven Web Apps using Shiny part 3\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunicating COVID-19 models through Markdown documents, web sites, pre-print papers and Shiny apps – guest presentation by Dr Mark Hanly\n\n\n2-4:30pm (F2F) & 5:30-8pm (online), Thur 28 Jul\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 10\n\n\nMon 01 August\n\n\nCourse Review and Group Project Presentations\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualising higher dimensions – uses and misuses of 3D graphics; dimensionality reduction techniques, including guest presentation by Dr Meg Stevens on visualising NLP models\n\n\n2-4:30pm (F2F) & 5:30-8pm (online), Thur 4 Aug\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeams Space\nDiscussions, questions and online tutorials will be hosted in the course Teams Space which you can access here.\n\nThe tutorials R packages\nOnline, hosted versions of the learnr tutorials for this course can be accessed through the links in the Course Schedule table above, but it is better to use a local copy that you can work on in the RStudio environment without the need for internet access.\nOnce installed, the tutorials can be accessed via the Tutorial tab in the upper righthand pane of the RStudio application.\nThe tutorials for Chapter 1 are shipped in the package cbdrhintro. To install this package you can enter the following code at the console:\n\n\ndevtools::install_github(\"CBDRH/cbdrhintro\")\n\n\n\nYou may get prompted to update some packages. You can chose to ignore this by selecting option 3 (None).\n\nIf you choose to update packages, you may subsequently be asked if you want to install binary or source versions. Source versions require special tools to compile which you may not have configured, so you should choose to install the binary version, i.e. if prompted Do you want to install from sources the packages which need compilation? enter n for ‘No’.\nThe package installation can occasionally fail, usually if there is a dependency that is not installed or has an outdated version. If you get an error message relating to a package, try installing that package first and then try again. If there are still issues, don’t worry, just drop an email to the course convenor.\nPlease note: if you have installed the cbdrhintro previously, you will need to re-install it again because we have added a tutorial for dplyr required for Chapter 1 of this course.\nInstructions for installing the R tutorials package for Chapter 2 to 9 of the HDAT9800 course will appear here in the near future.\n\nBack to the top \n\nAssessments\nWeekly core curriculum assessments\nThere are weekly individual assessments for Chapters 1 to 7. Each of these assessments is worth 8% of the total marks for the course, thus 56% all together. These weekly assessments cover the core course material and should be fairly easy and will not take very long to complete if you have worked through the core curriculum material. The weekly assessments must be submitted for marking no later than three weeks after the opening date for the chapter they relate to – the exact dates for each are shown in the table below.\nAdditional curriculum assessments\nThere are also two additional assignments. These relate to topics covered in the Thursday tutorial sessions, but require additional independent research and some creativity to complete. Each is worth 7% of the total course marks, thus 14% all together. The exact dates on which each these are due is also shown in the table below.\n\nIn the 2021 running of this course we set these additional assessment tasks every week. However, feedback from students was that the assessment burden was too great and that they didn’t have time to do the additional asessments justice. Therefore we have reduced the number of these additional assessments to just two this year.\nGroup assessment\nIn week 6 of the course, you will be asked to form into small groups of 3 or 4 students each, to undertake a group assessment task. More details of this task will be provided in week 4 of the course. Each group will be required to present their group project in the Thursday sessions in week 10, and then submit all the code for the project in the week following that. The group assessment is worth 30% of the overall course marks.\n\n\nAssessment\n\n\nWeight\n\n\nDue date\n\n\nRepo link\n\n\nChapter 1 assessment\n\n\n8%\n\n\n9am, Mon 20 Jun\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 2 assessment\n\n\n8%\n\n\n9am, Mon 27 Jun\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional assessment A\n\n\n7%\n\n\n9am, Thur 14 Jul\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 3 assessment\n\n\n8%\n\n\n9am, Mon 4 Jul\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 4 assessment\n\n\n8%\n\n\n9am, Mon 11 Jul\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 5 assessment\n\n\n8%\n\n\n9am, Mon 18 Jul\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional assessment B\n\n\n7%\n\n\n9am, Thur 4 Aug\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 6 assessment\n\n\n8%\n\n\n9am, Mon 25 Jul\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 7 assessment\n\n\n8%\n\n\n9am, Mon 1 Aug\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup assessment\n\n\n30%\n\n\n9am, Mon 7 Aug\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick the link to clone a personal copy of the GitHub repo for each assessment.
