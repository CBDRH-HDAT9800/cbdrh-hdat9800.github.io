# Introduction to the core curriculum content for this chapter (Dr James Farrow)

```

# What's in the lectures and tutorials for this Chapter?

* Part 1
  * An overview of literate programming
  * Introduction to literate programming in the R ecosystem: R markdown and knitr
* Part 2
  * a quick look at some additional output formats for knitr

View the lecture videos (below), and download the lecture notes (available for Part A only, there is no slide deck for part B) if you want to follow along with the presenter (or for revision later). 

There is also an interactive `learnr` tutorial covering literate programming using `knitr`. This covers much of the same material as the Part 1 lecture for Chapter 2, but goes into a bit more detail. 

Links and further instructions for each component are provided in the sections below.

# Pre-recorded lectures for Chapter 2

View the lecture videos below, and download the lecture notes if you want to follow along with the presenter (or for revision later). 

*  **Part 1**

```


**There is no slide deck for Part 2.***

After you have viewed the lectures, please proceed to do the related `knitr` tutorial (see below).


# `learnr` tutorial for Chapter 2

You should download and install the `hdat9800` tutorials package for `R` by following the instructions provided on the home page. Instructions for installing `R` and `RStudio` are provided [here](installing_r.html).

**Note*: Essentially the same tutorial is contained in the `cbdrhintro` tutorials package. However, you should do the one called "**Chapter 2: knitr**" because it is slightly more up-to-date. We will endeavour to fix this duplication of tutorials in the near future. However, it doesn't really matter which version of the `knitr` tutorial you do.

The tutorial is also available online via the link from the course schedule table on the course home page.

The tutorial covers much of the same material as in the pre-recorded lectures, but goes into a bit more detail. See below for suggested practical exercises to be undertaken after you have finished reviewing the tutorial.

If you have any questions about the lectures or tutorials, or if you want to share any useful resources or post insights, please post in the [Teams space](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a7ce6b5565a284b51b0e85c20ad2bcc2a%40thread.tacv2/Chapter%25202?groupId=40f150b6-6fa9-478e-875f-cd02465b18a2&tenantId=3ff6cfa4-e715-48db-b8e1-0867b9f9fba3) for the course, in the channel for Chapter 2.

## Optional practical exercises (not assessed or marked)

* Practice creating some R markdown documents of different types (reports, presentations), add your own text, images and R code (any code you wish), and render (knit) them in different formats (HTML, PDF) and compare how they are rendered and behave.

* Install the `rticles` package in RStudio, and use it to create an R markdown manuscript document for one of the scholarly journals it supports (PLOS One or ArXiv are good choices).

If you wish, post examples of your rendered (knitted) documents as HTML or PDF files attached to The Chapter 2 channel in the course teams space.

# Interactive sessions for Chapter 2

![](images/rmarkdown_wizards.png)

The Chapter 2 interactive sessions (online Wednesday at 6pm, face-to-face Thursday at 2pm) will cover the following topics:

* Q&A on Chapter 2 (and Chapter 1) curriculum material
* discussion of the core readings for this week (see below, please reading them before the section if possible, but we will be briefly recapping the main points)
* a hands-on workshop on creating your own health data science blog site using the Distill literate programming framework for `R`, `Rmarkdown` and `knitr`.

For the hands-on workshop, you will need your laptop with `R` and `RStudio` installed, and access to your GitHub account. The `distill` package for R (and its dependencies, which will automatically be installed too) will be needed. If possible, you should install that before the session.

The session will not go as long as the Chapter 1 session, and we will take a break for 5 minutes every hour!

The slide deck in HTML (web) format for the session can be accessed <a class='fa fa-file-powerpoint' href='Chapter-2-distill/HDAT9800-Chapter-2-distill.html' target='_blank'> here</a> (or as a <a class='fa fa-file-pdf' href='assets/HDAT9800-Chapter-2-distill.pdf' target='_blank'> PDF</a>).

There is an additional video which illustrates each of the steps in creating a blog site:

# Chapter 2 assessment exercise

For chapter 2, the assessment exercise is slightly more involved than Chapter 1, and is intended to give you some practice editing Rmarkdown documents. Access the assessment the same way as for Chapter 1, by clicking on this link to the Chapter 2 assessment GitHub Classroom repository:  [https://classroom.github.com/a/tOV9OQvh](https://classroom.github.com/a/tOV9OQvh)

This will create a new GitHub repository for you, just for this assignment. Only you and the course instructors can access it, it is not public.

You should then clone this assignment repository to your local computer, using RStudio (or other git interfaces such as GitHub Desktop if you prefer). Complete the assignment (assessment task) according to the instructions given, save and commit your work to your local git repository, and then push that work back to the remote `GitHub` repository for the assessment (this should all be automatically set up when you clone the repo in RStudio).

**Be sure that you can successfully knit the `Rmd` (R markdown) document that you will be working on in those assessment, before you commit and push your final version. The instructors will be marking your `Rmd` file by re-rendering it (re-knitting it).**

You may revise your assessment task(s) as many times as you wish. We will mark the last committed version that you push to the GitHub repository for your chapter assessment by the due date. 

## Requesting early marking

You may request early marking of your submitted assessment by following the steps outlined [here](requesting_early_marking.html).
