# What's in the lectures and tutorials for this Chapter?

* Part 1
  * An overview of literate programming
  * Introduction to literate programming in the R ecosystem: R markdown and knitr
* Part 2
  * a quick look at some additional output formats for knitr

View the lecture videos (below), and download the lecture notes (available for Part A only, there is no slide deck for part B) if you want to follow along with the presenter (or for revision later). 

After you have viewed the lectures, please proceed to the tutorials.

There is also an interactive `learnr` tutorial covering literate programming using `knitr`. This covers much of the same material as the Part 1 lecture for Chapter 2, but goes into a bit more detail. 

Links and further instructions for each component are provided in the sections below.

# Pre-recorded lectures for Chapter 2

View the lecture videos below, and download the lecture notes if you want to follow along with the presenter (or for revision later). 

*  **Part 1**

```{r ch2-part1-video, preview=TRUE}

```

* **Part 2**

embed_url("https://youtu.be/j8dx_EIux9A")
```


**There is no slide deck for Part 2.***

After you have viewed the lectures, please proceed to do the related `knitr` tutorial (see below).


# `learnr` tutorial for Chapter 2

You should download and install the `hdat9800` tutorials package for `R` by following the instructions provided on the home page. Intructions for installing `R` and `RStudio` are provided [here](installing_r.html).

**Note*: Essentially the same tutorial is contained in the `cbdrhintro` tutorials package. However, you should do the one called "**Chapter 2: knitr**" because it is slightly more up-to-date. We will endeavour to fix this duplication of tutorials in the near future. However, it doesn't really matter which version of the `knitr` tutorial you do.

The tutorial is also available online via the link from the course schedule table on the course home page.

The tutorial covers much of the same material as in the pre-recorded lectures, but goes into a bit more detail. See below for suggested practical exercises to be undertaken after you have finished reviewing the tutorial.

If you have any questions about the lectures or tutorials, or if you want to share any useful resources or post insights, please post in the [Teams space](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a7ce6b5565a284b51b0e85c20ad2bcc2a%40thread.tacv2/Chapter%25202?groupId=40f150b6-6fa9-478e-875f-cd02465b18a2&tenantId=3ff6cfa4-e715-48db-b8e1-0867b9f9fba3) for the course, in the channel for Chapter 2.

## Optional practical exercises (not assessed or marked)

* Practice creating some R markdown documents of different types (reports, presentations), add your own text, images and R code (any code you wish), and render (knit) them in different formats (HTML, PDF) and compare how they are rendered and behave.

* Install the `rticles` package in RStudio, and use it to create an R markdown manuscript document for one of the scholarly journals it supports (PLOS One or ArXiv are good choices).

If you wish, post examples of your rendered (knitted) documents as HTML or PDF files attached to The Chapter 2 channel in teh course teams space.

# Interactive sessions for Chapter 2

Details will appear here shortly.

# Chapter 2 assessment exercise
