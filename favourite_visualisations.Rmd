In no particular order.

From one of Edward Tufte's amazing series of books in data visualisation, in this case _Beautiful Evidence_..

![Beautful Evidence](images/tufte_beautiful_evidence.png)

...the page in which he introduces teh idea of _sparklines_, which are very small charts, stripped of all but the most releveant information and detail, which can be embedded in text (and tables). We will examone the use of sparklines later in this course.

The now-famous Johns Hopkins COVID-19 map site, that became a major source of COVID updates in 202 and 2021. A great example of a health information dashboard, in this case built using the commercial ESRI GIS (geographic information system) software platform.

A World Bank project using unsupervised ML (machine learning) clustering of topics in large numbers of project reports. This methods finds emergent topic clusters in high dimensions. In order to visualise these, the high number of dimensions needs to be flattened using a technique called t-SNE, which we will examine briefly in this course.

The full World Bank report containing this image can be accessed [here](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/37117/Advanced-Content-Analysis-Can-Artificial-Intelligence-Accelerate-Theory-Driven-Complex-Program-Evaluation.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y
).
